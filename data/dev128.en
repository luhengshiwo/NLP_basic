Scientists hope to derive practical information from these missions about exactly how the solar wind produces magnetic storms near the Earth that can disrupt communication systems and trigger power outages, resulting in losses estimated at $100 million each year worldwide.
Ulysses, meanwhile, became the first spacecraft to fly over a polar region of the Sun when, in June 1994, it began its primary mission to observe the solar wind at high-solar latitudes.
Built by ESA and equipped with both European and United States instruments, Ulysses will take direct measurements of many complex solar phenomena that cannot be observed remotely.
Scientists are eager to learn more about the Sun's polar magnetic fields, which reverse polarity every 11 years in conjunction with the solar cycle; they play an important role in the Sun's corona and solar wind.
The ionic composition of the solar wind, measured by Ulysses, indicates that its source in the coronal gas measures just over a million degrees Centigrade.
This is not hot enough to make the wind go as fast as it does, indicating that some unknown electromagnetic process near the Sun is responsible for accelerating the solar wind.
In a separate development, researchers from the University of Alaska in Fairbanks recorded spectacular upper atmospheric flashes occurring above electrical thunderstorms.
For many years, pilots have noticed these bright blue and red flashes that last only a few thousandths of a second.
Using special low-light-level cameras mounted on two small aircraft, scientists recently captured these flashes on video for the first time.
They extended upward as high as 100 kilometers and some even reached through the Earth's ozone layer to the ionosphere.
After coordinating their measurements with scientists at other institutions, the researchers came to suspect that the flashes are a form of electrical discharge.
The scientists plan further study to understand the origin of the flashes and their potential impact on aircraft safety.
More broadly, this phenomenon links the weather in the Earth's lower atmosphere to upper atmospheric layers that form our planet's border to space.
In other weather-related space science, NASA conducted a series of sounding rocket flights during FY 1994 to examine the Alaskan auroras.
Space physicists are interested in these colorful phenomena known as "Northern Lights" because they are caused by variations in the solar wind's interaction with the Earth's magnetic field.
Equipped with sophisticated payloads, sounding rockets flew directly through the auroras, allowing scientists to take direct measurements of the ions' energy levels.
Researchers hope to gain a better understanding of how these particles are accelerated and energized.
This campaign of eight rocket flights formed a significant part of the Space Physics Division's 41 rocket flights this fiscal year.
Because of their extreme luminosity at maximum light, Type Ia supernovae have proved themselves to be valuable in measuring both the local rate of expansion of the universe and the rate of change of that expansion.
Recent work by Mark Phillips of the Cerro-Tolodo Interamerican Observatory in Chile has shown that there is a significant spread in the intrinsic radiated energy in visible light of this key subtype of supernova.
That spread can introduce a bias in samples of distant supernovae, leading to erroneous estimates of universal deceleration.
Phillips and his collaborators found a good correlation between the rate of decline with time of the luminous output of supernovae and their peak brightness.
The strength of the spectral features can be used to increase the accuracy of the estimate of each supernova's intrinsic brightness and therefore, its distance.
The use of this technique now places supernovae among the most accurate of the standard candles, suitable for use as distant probes measuring features of the early universe.
A series of systematic observations by astronomers has long suggested the existence of a "Great Attractor," a concentration of mass that causes a bulk flow of galaxies toward it.
Scientists discovered this large-scale flow by comparing the motion of the local group with respect to clusters versus the motion with respect to the cosmic microwave background, which is assumed to be a "stationary" reference.
The strength of such large-scale flows can distinguish among models that explain the formulation of galaxies and clusters in the early universe.
More recently, astronomers have begun to examine large volumes of space to search for structure and flows on even larger scales.
Work by Todd R. Lauer (National Optical Astronomy Observatories) and Marc Postman (Space Telescope Science Institute), using the Kitt Peak National Observatory's 4- and 2.1-meter telescopes in Arizona and the Cerro-Tolodo Interamerican Observatory's 1.5-meter telescope in Chile, suggests that bulk flows can be identified over scales as large as some 600 million light-years, almost three times larger than those found in previous investigations.
They used the brightest galaxies to measure the distances and velocities of 119 clusters, creating the cluster reference frame.
The motion of the local group of galaxies derived with respect to these galaxy clusters was significantly different from the one derived with respect to the cosmic microwave background.
The most straightforward interpretation of this result is that all the galaxies in the volume of space defined by these clusters are streaming with a velocity of nearly 700 kilometers per second and that any "attractor" has to lie beyond the boundaries of the original search.
A structure this large cannot be explained by any current theoretical model and opens fruitful new directions for understanding the scale of the largest structures in the universe.
The application of seismology to the study of the solar interior has advanced almost solely by the prediction and measurement of the Sun's frequencies of oscillation.
Thomas L. Duvall (Goddard Space Flight Center), Stuart Jeffries (Bartol), Jack W. Harvey (National Solar Observatory, Tucson) and Martin A. Pomerantz (Bartol) have shown that it is also possible to obtain direct measurements of the travel times and distances of individual acoustic (sound-like) waves, which is the predominant approach in terrestrial seismology.
The basic concept is simple: At the surface, a wave propagating upward from the interior is reflected back downwards by the steep change in the density of the gas at the Sun's surface.
As the wave travels into the interior, its path is curved back toward the surface by refraction, caused by the strong increase of temperature with increasing depth.
If the upward wave causes a brightening in the area of the Sun's surface, then there will be a correlated brightening where the wave resurfaces at a later time.
By measuring this time difference as a function of the distance of separation of two surface locations, it is possible to develop a plot of the travel time versus the distance of separation, a plot familiar from terrestrial seismology.
The initial work showed that acoustic waves with frequencies of oscillation greater than a critical value predicted from the physical conditions in the solar atmosphere are not significantly reflected by the atmosphere, with less than 2-percent reflection coefficient.
This approach opens the way for seismic studies of local solar phenomena, such as inhomogeneities beneath the Sun's surface near sunspots.
It should also help refine models of the gas velocities below the Sun's surface.
Drs. Joseph Taylor and Russell Hulse of Princeton University won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery using the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico of the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16 and their subsequent monitoring and analysis of this object.
Their work demonstrated convincingly the appropriateness of general relativity as a theory of gravitation under extreme conditions and indirectly confirmed the existence of the gravitational radiation Albert Einstein had predicted.
In more recent use of the Arecibo radio telescope, continued timing of the millisecond binary pulsar PSR B1257+12 by its discoverer, Alexander Wolszczan of Pennsylvania State University, has greatly strengthened the case for the previously-announced pair of planets that orbit this object; the observations have begun to show the expected effects that the planets' mutual gravity has on their orbital motion.
The observations have also revealed the presence of a third planetary body, with a mass only 1.5 percent that of the Earth, that orbits the central neutron stars at a distance of only 0.2 astronomical units.
Observations of gas clouds associated with the high-redshift quasar PC 1643+4631A using the 42 and 12-meter radio telescopes at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO--Kitt Peak, Arizona) have revealed the presence of carbon monoxide emission.
Clouds such as this have been identified previously with the progenitors of current galaxies.
The red shift of the molecular spectral lines indicates that they were emitted when the universe was about one-fifth of its present age.
The observations by David T. Frayer, NRAO associate director Robert L. Brown, and NRAO director Paul A. Venden Bout are striking in that they indicate a molecular mass of 4.5 trillion solar masses.
This equals the stellar mass of a large galaxy, but here the material apparently lies in an extended, gaseous, prestellar state.
Also noteworthy are the substantial quantities of carbon and oxygen that make up the carbon monoxide molecules; these elements must have themselves been produced in a burst of massive star formation preceding the observed protogalactic state.
The National Science Foundation's (NSF) Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica (CARA) made wintertime astrophysical observations from NSF's observatory at South Pole for the first time during the austral winter of 1994.
CARA's South Pole Infrared EXplorer (SPIREX) telescope was able, because of its unique location, to image more of the impacts of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter than any other instrument.
Also, site measurements by SPIREX confirmed that the sky at South Pole is darker by a factor of at least three than any other site previously surveyed.
Another of CARA's experiments is on the Cosmic Background Radiation Anisotropy; at the end of the fiscal year, it consisted of a suite of two telescopes designated PYTHON and VIPER.
PYTHON has made measurements at South Pole during the past two austral summers and has now been operated for the first time during winter.
It has made important confirmation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropy first measured by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE), launched in 1989, and it has begun to make a finer scale map of the CMB than is possible with the smaller antennas of COBE.
The quiet atmospheric conditions at South Pole have allowed PYTHON to make measurements of unprecedented sensitivity.
Using new data from the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA, launched by Japan in February 1993) about two supernova remnants (designated E0519-69.0 and N103B) in the Large Megallanic Cloud, a binational team of astronomers led by SAO's John P. Hughes discovered significant amounts of iron, calcium, and other newly synthesized elements.
ASCA gives astronomers a better tool for direct observation of the emissions from many atoms, including oxygen, silicon, calcium, and iron, in the ejected gas of supernovae, lasting for many hundreds of years after the explosion that created the supernova.
Scientists believe that the explosions which created the remnants occurred somewhere between 500 and 1,500 years ago. The obvious presence of iron emissions coupled with the lack of strong oxygen emission suggests that these remnants belong to the select group of supernova explosions that produced the bulk of the iron in the universe, according to Hughes.
Further study of the new data should help astronomers refine current models of supernova explosions and "because of the ubiquitous presence of iron throughout the universe," Hughes expected the results to have a large influence on astronomy in general.
Two other SAO scientists, Dong-Woo Kim and Giuseppina Fabbiano, discovered a huge, hot, gaseous halo surrounding a distant galaxy, perhaps providing evidence for the presence of both dark matter and so-called cooling flows.
This, in turn, may shed new light on whether the universe is open or closed.
The two astronomers used the joint German-United States-U.K. x-ray satellite Roentgen Satellite (ROSAT), launched in June 1990, to observe an x-ray-bright elliptical galaxy, NGC 507, some 300 million light years from Earth.
Measuring the temperatures of x-ray-emitting hot gas, they observed a steady decrease of heat toward the galaxy's center.
They believe this fall in temperatures may result from cooling flows in the central region.
Also, uncertainty in measurements of the mass of NGC 507 suggest that a large amount of dark matter may be present.
Observations indicate that baryonic matter (mass seen as stars and gas in all wavelengths) makes up some 15 percent of the estimated total mass of the galaxy.
Since current cosmological theory predicts that baryonic mass must be less than 5 percent to "close" the universe, this finding has implications for cosmology.
However, similar measurements of many other systems will be necessary before scientists can determine whether the universe is open or closed.
B. Solar system exploration
Closer to home, scientists were also making new discoveries about our own solar system.
For example, ground observations conducted under the Near Earth Object program detected the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet in 1993 and predicted its impact upon Jupiter in July 1994.
This event marked one of the more spectacular results of a detailed, long-term telescopic survey of the night sky at Palomar Observatory, California, by United States Geological Survey (USGS) geologist Eugene M. Shoemaker and two volunteers, Carolyn S. Shoemaker and David H. Levy.
It was the first totally disrupted (fragmented) comet ever to be observed, and the first to be seen orbiting and impacting a planet.
For the first time, the worldwide scientific community was able to predict and track such a crash.
A total of 21 observable fragments collided with Jupiter over a week-long period.
The impact, observed in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the ultraviolet to long radio wavelengths, produced fireballs that left major visible marks on the planet; it revealed a clearcut need for an inventory of comets and asteroids that may someday collide with Earth.
During the last few months of the fiscal year, scientists under contract to the Defense Nuclear Agency (DNA) used their expertise in simulation and modeling of the nuclear effects in the Earth's atmosphere to explain the enhanced radio emission data resulting from measurements in various radio frequency bands from Jupiter's magnetosphere during the impact.
Their findings, in line with a shock acceleration model, suggest a greater effect than had previously been assumed.
As the fiscal year ended, previous calculations were being refined in collaboration with a variety of radio and optical observers and investigators.
In anticipation of the collision of the comet with Jupiter, the Divisions of Astronomical Sciences and Atmospheric Sciences within the NSF and the Solar System Exploration Division of NASA sponsored a special program to support observational and theoretical investigations into the mechanism of energy deposition into different regions of Jupiter's atmosphere.
Theoretical models account for the amount and velocity of material ejected during the collisions as well as the chemical reactions that occur as a result of the interaction of this material with the neutral and ionized components of Jupiter's atmosphere.
The impact is expected to have generated dust that, on being charged through exposure to the plasma environment, will form new dust rings around the planet.
Data obtained from a variety of instruments strategically deployed to observe the effects of the impacts will test the theoretical predictions.
NASA scientists also made exciting new strides in lunar studies while working on the Department of Defense (DoD)-sponsored Clementine mission.
This effort, in which lunar research was only one of the goals, was conducted by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) with the support of NASA, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. Launched on January 25, 1994, the Clementine spacecraft entered lunar orbit on February 19, 1994.
For the next 2 1/2 months, four cameras took 1.8 million images of the surface of the Moon in 11 discreet wavebands with coarse altimetry over most of the lunar surface, resulting in the first comprehensive digital map of that surface.
In addition, NASA scientists are excited to have multispectral surface data covering 11 colors in the visible and infrared spectra.
Instruments such as a laser ranger, a charged particle telescope, advanced thermal imagers, and radio tracking gear also contributed significant new information about the Moon's topography, surface composition, and charged particle environment.
For example, the lidar system compiled a complete map of lunar elevations, discovering a 12-kilometer-deep impact crater at the lunar south pole in the process.
An in-flight contrived experiment to use the communications transmitter for active, bistatic measurements produced supportive but not conclusive evidence for the existence of ice in the permanent shadows of craters near the lunar poles.
NASA planned to sponsor a series of multiyear grants to scientists to examine Clementine's lunar data in expectation of discovering new insights about the Moon's formation.
The USGS has begun processing the Clementine data to produce global digital maps, as well.
A secondary mission of Clementine, a deep-space encounter with the asteroid 1620 Geographos, could not be completed because of a problem that occurred after completion of the lunar mapping mission.
Galileo, on the other hand, did complete its encounter with the asteroid Ida and in the process made the curious discovery of the first confirmed moon around an asteroid.
This was the 1.5-kilometer-in-diameter satellite, Dactyl.
Although scientists previously believed that natural satellites of asteroids probably existed, they now contend that such moons may be more widespread than previously considered.
As the fiscal year ended researchers were busy examining data about Ida's moon to learn how both bodies were formed.
One possibility is that the moon was formed during the explosion of a larger asteroid of heterogeneous composition that also gave birth to Ida.
Spectral analysis by Galileo's near-infrared mapping spectrometer revealed that Dactyl is composed of different amounts of specific compounds than Ida, indicating that it did not come directly from Ida.
New data gathered by Galileo indicate that Ida's composition is more diverse than previously thought.
By examining the moon's orbital parameters, scientists, including those from NASA and the USGS, can better determine Ida's mass.
Combining this information with prior data on Ida's size will enable scientists to deduce the asteroid's density and composition.
While on its way to Jupiter, Galileo also examined another asteroid, Gaspra, which, like Ida, travels in the main asteroid belt orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter.
In other planetary exploration, the Magellan spacecraft, launched in May 1989, determined that Venus is still geologically active.
After completing the mapping of the planet's surface, Magellan began collecting information about its density.
By tracking the spacecraft's precise speed over specific areas of the planet, ground controllers back on Earth calculated the strength of gravity in these locations and thus the subsurface density.
The data indicate that Venusian areas of high gravity correspond to areas of high elevation, in contrast to the situation on Earth, where mountain ranges correspond to gravitational lows.
Relatedly, the USGS successfully completed the first full-resolution global radar mosaic of Venus (1:1,500,000 scale); a series of 170 CD-ROMs containing the same spacecraft data was in production as the fiscal year ended.
Nearly half of the 1:1,500,000-scale geologic base map quadrangles have been completed to support NASA's Venus Geologic Mapping Program.
In addition, the USGS has been involved in planning for unpiloted missions NASA proposes to send to Mars, including Pathfinder (a lander with a small rover projected for 1996-97), at least two orbiters named Mars Global Surveyor, and a series of Mars Surveyor landers.
Geologists from the Survey served on the Pathfinder imaging team and helped plan for a wide range of Pathfinder experiments and geologic observations, including selection of a landing site at the mouth of a large Martian outflow channel.
Survey personnel also helped plan for Surveyor orbiter and lander missions projected to take place between 1998 and 2005.
C. Other space science
NASA made significant strides in microgravity and life sciences research during FY 1994, beginning with the Spacelab Life Sciences-2 (SLS-2) mission in October 1993.
Its payload consisted of 14 experiments that examined physiological responses of humans and rodents to microgravity and their subsequent readaptation to Earth's gravity.
As an extension of the SLS-1 mission in June 1991, research on SLS-2 focused on identifying and further characterizing the changes in physiological systems during and after space flight and on increasing our knowledge about underlying mechanisms so we can minimize or counteract changes adverse to human health before the international Space Station begins its operations.
Important findings from SLS-2 included independent demonstration by three different investigator teams that current models for understanding the effects of gravity on the heart, lungs, and circulation could not predict the observed physiological responses during space flight.
These studies will yield important new understanding of blood pressure regulation, in health and disease, and of cardiopulmonary disorders.
Researchers also learned that a surprising degree of neural plasticity results from exposure to microgravity.
These results will improve our understanding of the nervous system's adaptation to change.
Research into the role that physical loading (gravity) plays in maintaining muscle function--combining anatomy, biochemistry, and functional measures--will help the joint NASA-National Institutes of Health (NIH) program in muscle physiology.
The flight of a cosmonaut on STS-60 in February 1994 began Phase 1 of the international Space Station.
In August, the first launch of United States research hardware aboard a Russian Progress rocket included an acceleration measurement system to support both United States and Russian research programs.
Additional United States hardware is being tested and shipped to Russia for launch aboard Progress rockets next year.
