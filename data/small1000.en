On 10 December 1982, the General Assembly adopted resolution 37/90 in which it endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.
In that resolution, the Assembly decided, inter alia, that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should disseminate, through panel meetings and seminars, information on new and advanced technology and applications, with emphasis on their relevance and implications for developing countries.
The United Nations/European Space Agency Workshop on Applications of Space Techniques to Prevent and Combat Natural Disasters was one of the activities of the Programme for 1995 that were endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994.
The Workshop was organized in cooperation with the Government of Zimbabwe.
It was hosted by the Environment and Remote Sensing Institute (ERSI) and held at Harare, from 22 to 26 May 1995, for participants from developing countries of the region covered by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA).
The objectives of the Workshop were (a) to expose the participants, particularly managers of emergency response agencies, to ways and means of utilizing space technology (remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite communications, positioning by satellites) to prevent or mitigate the effects of natural disasters; and (b) to address the development of databases and their use with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to prevent disasters or to monitor, mitigate and redress the effects of disasters when they occur.
The presentations to the Workshop covered the use of remote sensing, satellite meteorology, satellite positioning systems and satellite communications and how they could be used, separately or collectively, to prevent disasters or to forecast, monitor and mitigate the effects of severe weather phenomena, such as flooding, desertification and drought.
The presentations also addressed the extent to which the same technologies could mitigate the effects of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The Workshop concluded with discussions on the needs of the emergency response services, the capabilities of space technology to satisfy those needs and the actions that would be necessary in the short- and medium-term to take advantage of those capabilities.
The participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries.
B. Organization and programme of the Workshop The participants were professionals with several years experience in managerial positions with national and regional emergency response agencies and services.
Other participants had several years experience in remote sensing, satellite meteorology and the use of databases such as GIS.
Sixty-nine experts from 18 States Members of the United Nations and eight international and regional organizations participated in the Workshop; 44 participants represented 14 developing countries from the ECA region.
The Workshop was attended by participants from the following countries and international organizations: Benin, Botswana, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
Presentations were made by experts from Ghana, France, Japan, Norway, South Africa, United Republic of Tanzania, United States of America and Zimbabwe; from European Space Agency (ESA), International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (regional delegation for Southern Africa), International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations/International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (UNDHA/IDNDR), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs, as well as by a representative of the Globalstar satellite communications company.
Funds allocated by the United Nations and ESA were used to defray the air travel and per diem expenses of 14 participants from 11 developing countries of the ECA region.
The Government of Zimbabwe, through ERSI, provided the conference facilities and the Government also provided local transportation for all participants in the Workshop.
The programme of the Workshop (annex I), was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA.
The Workshop held plenary and working group meetings.
At the latter, the participants discussed the issues related to the use of space technologies to prevent and combat the effects of natural disasters.
The working papers of these groups are given in annexes II-V.
A. Observations of the Workshop The critical factors that distinguish natural phenomena from natural disasters are loss of life and property.
Certainly, humans cannot prevent the occurrence of natural phenomena such as typhoons, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
Their disastrous effects, however, can be lessened significantly if well-conceived disaster-response plans and mitigation strategies are in place prior to their occurrence.
The Workshop noted that developing countries were particularly subject to natural disasters on a scale that overwhelmed the capacity of the societies concerned to cope with their aftermath.
In many cases, just one such destructive episode was sufficient to destroy the social and economic infrastructure, including the communications network.
A single major disaster could disrupt the distribution of food and water supplies, medical services, and both the local and international communication links of the stricken communities.
The Workshop noted that many of the national and regional emergency response agencies and services were not aware of the full spectrum of applications of space technology. Of particular concern was the lack of awareness of the Earth observing systems that could provide essential data for the prevention of disasters or for the mitigation and relief of their effects.
To a lesser degree, the same observations applied to satellite communications, particularly regarding recent developments in mobile communications.
In the case of natural disasters, such technology could restore communications with the local headquarters for rescue and relief operations as well as with the outside world.
During the last session of the Workshop, the participants defined four categories of disaster-related topics that needed to be addressed: data supply, information generation, decision-making and implementation/execution.
To develop outlines of recommendations that could be useful in disaster-related activities, the participants assigned themselves to one of the above groups according to their professional background. II. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS
In recent years, the frequency and magnitude of major disasters, whether of a natural, technological or ecological origin, have made the world community aware of the immense loss of human life and economic resources that are regularly caused by such calamities.
Particularly hard hit are developing countries, for which the magnitude of disasters frequently outstrips the ability of the society to cope with them.
It was stated that this was due to the fact that 95 per cent of all disasters occurred in developing countries.
Over the past 20 years, the frequency and severity of natural disasters have increased.
Over this timespan, 3 million people have been killed and 1 billion have been affected by natural disasters.
Hardly a week goes by without a major disaster.
Since the earthquake in Kobe, Japan, in January 1995, there have been over 20 large disasters reported in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
Civil strife, such as the recent events in Rwanda, also affects people, the economy and the infrastructure in ways similar to a very large natural disaster.
To date, relief continues to be the main form of disaster management.
Approximately 95 per cent of all resources spent on disaster-related activities are for relief and recovery operations.
Nevertheless, disasters can be reduced if adequate research and proven prevention, preparedness and emergency measures are taken.
The effects of disasters can only be reduced through the deployment of the very best systems and knowledge, and following well-prepared overall national and regional contingency plans.
A single hazardous event can destroy the social and economic infrastructure, including communications systems, that may have taken years to develop and upon whose vitality local and national economies depend.
Even in normal times, particularly in developing countries, the capacities of these infrastructures are often strained to manage even the most basic social and economic development programmes, and a single disaster can severely disrupt the community lifelines that provide food distribution, water supplies, health-care services, waste disposal and communications locally and with the rest of the world.
In order to realize their fullest potential, developing countries need a sustained period of social and economic growth.
Major impediments to sustained growth are disasters, which often result in an affected country shifting its economic policies to sustain the energy required to cope with disaster response and subsequent reconstruction.
These shifts can intensify a country's financial imbalances and deplete available resources.
In many cases such a situation can be prevented.
Frequently, the difference between saving and losing lives and property is an effective warning of an impending disaster.
Timely warning of a major natural hazard can reduce its consequences: at least, people may have enough time to save their lives; at most, they have an opportunity to relocate or otherwise protect their property.
A. The role of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
and the contribution of space technology The International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) 1990-1999 operates within the framework of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the United Nations and was proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 44/236 of 22 December 1989 with the objective of reducing, by concerted international action, especially in developing countries, the loss of life, property damage and social and economic disruption caused by natural disasters such as earthquakes, windstorms, tsunamis, floods, landslides, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, infestations of grasshoppers and locusts, droughts and desertification, and other calamities of natural origin.
The IDNDR secretariat recognizes that space technologies, including remote sensing, global positioning and satellite communications systems, offer disaster managers valuable tools that can be used to prepare for, mitigate and, in some cases, prevent the effects of disasters.
Appropriate applications of space technologies can also be used to respond more effectively to needs resulting from disasters.
IDNDR provides an international mechanism to focus attention on the benefits of applying these and other technologies.
Importantly, it directs the disaster management community beyond the issue of simply using state-of-the-art space technologies in disaster relief and early warning because it promotes a recognition that the national infrastructures that make possible these applications must be encouraged and supported.
Because of the typically high infrastructure investment that is required for constructing and managing space-based programmes, national, and local, systems are out of reach for most of the countries hardest hit by natural disasters.
Therefore, the IDNDR secretariat is seeking ways of encouraging the development of cooperative approaches for sharing space-based resources.
Although the sovereignty of the country affected by the disaster should be recognized, the planning and administration of this process must also include recipient countries.
The development of an autonomous basic research capability in scientific and technical disciplines, including space-related fields, should be a main goal as advocated in ongoing activities within the United Nations, most notably through the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
Such capability would promote creative thinking to adapt, modify and create new technologies that could contribute to national development and the reduction of casualties and property damage.
B. Regional disaster-related problems and projects
There are many disaster-reduction challenges confronting Southern Africa, the major hazards of concern being drought, epidemics, cyclones and storms, floods and armed conflict.
In 1991 and 1992, more than 20 million people in this region were defined as severely drought affected.
Drought in this region is also associated with other hazards, such as flash floods and epidemic diarrhoea, including cholera and dysentery.
In 1995 there have been flash floods in Botswana, northern Namibia and parts of Southern Africa.
Unfortunately, for Southern Africa, cholera and dysentery constitute a serious threat.
In 1993, more than 50,000 cases of cholera and up to 73,000 cases of shizella dysentery were recorded in five Southern African countries.
In 1994, more than 171,000 cases of dysentery were reported for Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, claiming nearly 600 lives.
Irrespective of whether the hazard is meteorological, such as a cyclone, epidemiological, such as a cholera outbreak, or hydrological, such as a drought, Southern Africa's most disaster prone communities are those already vulnerable due to poverty, isolation, and dependence on degraded land and location in crowded informal settlements.
Disaster reduction is synonymous with lowering this vulnerability, a daunting challenge facing Southern African governments during a time of fiscal restraint and economic structural adjustment.
In Zimbabwe, remote sensing and GIS projects started as small disjointed donor-funded projects that were designed to test the applicability of the technology in different fields of application.
The earliest pilot projects were in the fields of land-use planning and vegetation monitoring.
At that time, satellite data came in as computer compatible tapes in the diplomatic baggage of the technical personnel from donor countries.
In 1987, ERSI was inaugurated as a service centre to spearhead advances in the use of remote sensing and GIS technology.
The facility was set up as a joint project between the governments of Zimbabwe and Germany.
With time, it was realized that there was a need to coordinate the projects that were being developed all over the country in order to take advantage of already existing data sets, hardware and software to rationalize human and technical resources.
The research council of Zimbabwe established a subcommittee on remote sensing in an attempt to coordinate remote sensing activities in the country.
A working group on GIS was also established.
ERSI is presently involved in capacity building, both in-house and within the existing and new-user community.
The limited success in the control of land degradation and desertification may be attributed to a number of factors that include lack of data relating to the spatial and temporal dimensions of the problem.
High-resolution satellite remote sensing data is suitable for the collection of spatial data for broad planning and monitoring.
The possibility of assessing in particular the spatial and temporal dimensions of the problem of desertification is enhanced.
In Ghana, the most extensive use of high resolution satellite data to map current land use and cover for the country is currently taking place within the Remote Sensing Applications Unit of the Department of Geography, University of Ghana.
The project is using satellite image data to map land use at the scale of 1:250,000 as a part of the Environmental Information Systems Development component of the Ghana Environmental Resources Management Project (GERMP).
GERMP is part of the implementation of the Environmental Action Plan prepared by the Ghana Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
The other sets of data to be produced include topography, meteorology, soil suitability and land ownership.
These databases are expected to be available by 1997 to be organized into an environmental database that will be developed and shared in an environmental information systems network.
The Desertification Control Unit within EPA will be expected to use the maps to assess the medium-term and longer term effects of the many environmental and land-use programmes and projects currently being undertaken in all the ecological zones of the country, but particularly in the northern savannahs.
In the United Republic of Tanzania, recurring fire hazards, whether natural or human-made, have swept the vegetation off of various areas of the country except in the very wet rain forest.
Deliberate or accidental fires have had disastrous effects on the ecology and economy of the areas concerned.
In developing countries such as the United Republic of Tanzania, however, the deliberate burning of vegetation continues to aid farming and hunting of game in forested areas.
The impact of fire on forest land can be detected by using remote sensing techniques and GIS.
With respect to technology management, the latest GIS programs, IDRISI and TOSCA, have already been introduced in the United Republic of Tanzania through the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR).
It may be concluded that remote sensing images are a useful database source when used in conjunction with sufficient ground surveys in combating forest fires.
In 1992 a project was initiated in South Africa to develop a monitoring system for drought and vegetation conditions.
This operation requires information at regular intervals at a national level.
The advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) instrument carried by satellites of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the United States of America is the only commercial data source available to satisfy the needs and requirements of a fully operational exercise of this magnitude.
Unique properties, such as daily coverage of a large area, facilitate regular inventories to be made of natural events on a national scale.
Daily NOAA/AVHRR satellite images are used as a primary input source to produce monthly inventories of the whole country in the form of vegetation index maps.
Analyses and comparisons of current and historical maps enable the objective assessment of the effect of prevailing or emerging drought conditions in a timely fashion.
With proper calibration and the establishment of a continuous long-term database, this information will become a strong tool for decision makers and land managers.
C. Current and future possibilities for satellite communications
Traditional terrestrial telecommunications, particularly in remote areas of disaster-prone countries, have been costly to install, difficult to repair and vulnerable to damage.
Accordingly, such systems have been virtually useless in areas where geography or climate have inhibited their installation and maintenance, and thus have been of limited value to disaster managers.
Fixed satellite services, though useful in disaster planning and warning, have been of relatively limited effectiveness in disaster response, principally because of the need for large receiving and transmitting antennas and their associated high power requirement, and vulnerability to effects of disasters.
Mobile satellite services have been one of the most recent and dynamic communications technologies available to disaster managers.
This low-cost communication capability has proven, even in the relatively short time of its commercial availability, to offer dramatic results in relief efforts that have not been possible before.
Furthermore, as a complement to remote sensing and the global positioning system (GPS), space technology and GIS information management applications, mobile satellite services have the capability to dramatically improve risk assessment, disaster preparedness, early warning, and onset and post-disaster relief operations.
These services are now available to areas previously considered inaccessible because of their location, terrain, weather or demography.
In the future, global mobile communications systems, such as the many planned low Earth orbit (LEO) systems, will greatly enhance the disaster mitigation efforts of relief organizations.
Providing truly global personal communications, these systems, including the proposed Globalstar system, will provide a wide array of opportunities for information exchange through voice, digital data transfer and paging.
An alternate, or back-up capability, will also be provided to ground-based emergency alerting and local services for immediate reporting and request for assistance capabilities in natural disasters, accidents and other emergencies as well as aviation and marine navigation.
A few years ago the mobile satellite technologies that had for so long been employed on an experimental basis were only then beginning to be used in institutions.
Mobile satellite services offering land, aeronautical and maritime mobile communications are now being used regularly in disaster applications and will be used increasingly throughout the 1990s and beyond.
The growing awareness and consideration of these societal issues together with advances in spaceborne technology mean that effective, affordable and global mobile satellite communications and remote sensing capabilities that should significantly reduce the devastating effects of natural disasters should soon be implemented.
Because mobile satellite communications systems are independent of the local telecommunications infrastructure, they are not affected by natural disasters and they are frequently the only means of communications to and from a stricken area.
The Inmarsat satellite system can be used in all phases of dealing with natural disasters, monitoring and prediction, warning, and early intervention and emergency operations, and can also provide communications support for rehabilitation and reconstruction after a disaster strikes.
The 1994 IDNDR World Conference on Natural Disaster Reduction, held at Yokohama, Japan, identified telecommunications and information systems as two of the main elements of its "Strategy for a safer world and plan of action", which was subsequently endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/22 B of 20 December 1994.
The Tampere Conference in 1991, as well as the World Conference on Telecommunications Development of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), held at Buenos Aires in 1994 and the subsequent Kyoto Plenipotentiary Conference, endorsed the principle of maximum use of existing satellite and terrestrial telecommunications systems for disaster mitigation.
This includes the preparation of national disaster emergency and contingency plans, establishment of pools of expertise and equipment for such purposes, inclusion of emergency telecommunications systems in national development plans and revision of national regulatory policies to allow effective deployment of telecommunications in disasters and emergencies.
National contingency plans can help to minimize the impact of sudden natural disasters, for example by the pre-positioning of emergency supplies and communications equipment, including satellite communications systems, at strategic locations such as government premises and hospitals in areas known to be at risk.
As the process of identifying needs and the subsequent funding and deployment of satellite communications systems can take months, such activity has to be started as soon as possible.
For slowly developing disasters, such as droughts or famines, a different telecommunications strategy is needed.
The impact of disasters on sustainable development has been shown to be very severe.
As telecommunications are one of the essential tools for disaster management, the national emergency or disaster management planners need to consider how best to use the available networks and systems during the research and monitoring phase, as well as for contact with established international aid agencies during the relief phase.
Preparedness planning for all disasters and emergencies involves national civil defence, emergency response organizations and various government departments.
The military is increasingly called on to contribute in this role.
The International Committee of the Red Cross and other health organizations also participate.
An increasing number of preparations are being conducted on a regional basis.
While the levels of technical ability and understanding of technology of local personnel are steadily increasing, the main problem is lack of funds.
This, however, can often be overcome by international cooperation or external funding.
Monitoring weather and climate has long been an invaluable tool in predicting and combating natural disasters.
Inmarsat satellite communications systems help in the gathering and dissemination of meteorological data.
The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), for example, has been using the Inmarsat-C data messaging service to send observation data from ships at sea via Inmarsat Land Earth Stations in Southbury and Goonhilly in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
This global network of observatories using Inmarsat systems contributes to the prediction and monitoring of cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons and other variables affecting maritime weather.
Under the auspices of its Regional Centre for Training and Applications in Agrometeorology and Operational Hydrology (AGRHYMET) programme, WMO has recently established a network of land-based monitoring stations in western Africa.
A regional centre is located in Niger.
Observation posts in nine countries, each of them equipped with an Inmarsat-A portable satellite communication system, report regularly on climate and soil conditions in real-time, complementing GIS and remote sensing data.
Such information enables better medium- and long-range planning of agriculture and forestry activities, and helps more effective mitigation in an area covering millions of square kilometres.
UNEP is another Inmarsat user in Africa.
Inmarsat terminals coupled with appropriate sensors provide supervisory control and data acquisition.
Such equipment can play a vital role in providing or improving the monitoring and early warning functions, even from the most remote areas.
The monitoring of geothermal and volcanic variables, tectonic-plate movement and pressure ridges helps to identify potential volcanic or earthquake activity.
The United Nations has also recognized the utility of Inmarsat portable satellite communications systems.
Its United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) teams, dispatched to a disaster site within hours, routinely carry messaging or phone/fax satcoms when assessing disasters.
Their timely reports help to mobilize experts, supplies and equipment during the crucial 24-72 hours after disaster strikes.
The media also uses Inmarsat systems to report on disasters, especially for the transmission of compressed and slow-scan videos, still pictures and direct, high-quality audio broadcasts.
The media play a big part in highlighting a country's plight, which can help to expedite external assistance.
However, it is not only the media who need accurate and timely information.
During the acute phase of an emergency, speedy and accurate transmission of all relevant information is a major requirement for effective work by disaster relief organizations.
Lists and reports can be compiled quickly and transmitted via mobile satellite communications systems to disaster relief coordinators and other agencies using existing software programs for the management of personnel and supplies.
Immediately following a disaster, field workers in their vehicles or trucks carrying relief supplies often become immobilized due to local conditions.
Therefore, regular communications and position reporting is highly desirable.
Using Inmarsat mobile satellite communications systems and GPS, operations control is able to monitor the progress and location of all equipped vehicles, as well as send messages to them, regardless of the state of the local infrastructure, weather conditions and other impediments.
The introduction by INTELSAT of the new demand assignment multiple access (DAMA) service, especially for thin-route communications, will enhance connectivity in devastated areas. It will make digital satellite public switched services available to more users, especially in rural and remote areas.
DAMA is a flexible, pay-as-you-use service, offering improved connectivity at a low cost, while providing a complete digital solution for thin-route operators.
INTELSAT plans to introduce thin-route DAMA in April 1996 on a global transponder on the INTELSAT 605 at 24.5o east covering its Atlantic Ocean region.
This means that all gateway stations equipped with DAMA will be able to communicate with each other.
Implementation of DAMA service in the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean regions is expected shortly thereafter.
DAMA will benefit all users of the system, particularly those in developing countries.
INTELSAT expects DAMA to be of great benefit in re-establishing communications after natural disasters.
By bringing in fly-away transportable antennas, it will be possible to instantaneously re-establish contact with the rest of the world on the DAMA network.
In 1959, when Volunteers in Technical Assistance (VITA) was created to provide technical information and assistance to individuals and groups in developing countries, the first inquiries came from Africa.
Africa is still the principal user of the VITA Inquire Service.
VITA also supplies information on natural disasters and human-made crises such as civil strife and refugee movements.
In 1987, VITA established its Disaster Information Center.
One of the services provided by the Center is a telephone hotline.
When called on by the Government of the United States of America for assistance in responding to a disaster, within one day VITA activates its telephone bank, selects and trains volunteers, and begins to record offers and donations of medicine and other commodities.
The VITA hotline has provided information on civil strife, floods, cyclones, food shortages, earthquakes, droughts and rains in Algeria, Angola, Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Liberia, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, Southern Africa, Sudan, United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.
VITA has identified that one of the major needs for development is reliable communications and that the principal global telecommunications operators have little interest in providing service in most developing countries.
Therefore, VITA has developed its own communications programmes, which includes LEO satellites (VITASAT), terrestrial digital radio networks (VITAPAC) and electronic mail services (VITANET).
The VITA electronic bulletin board, VITANET, is a multi-line, commercial grade system that allows for on-line database searching, access to training materials, computer conferences, on-line surveys and file transfer utilities, all of which are enormously useful during a disaster and for disaster preparedness activities.
VITANET software interfaces will make it possible to link the VITA satellite system and packet radio networks, so that fully-automated end-to-end communications are possible.
In September 1994, VITA installed its own direct Internet host.
To date, the disaster ListServ has 129 subscribers who have received approximately 20,000 documents.
In addition, more than 12,000 documents were picked up through the its gopher.
The VITASAT global electronic messaging network is a satellite-based communications system for commercial, government and non-profit users worldwide.
It utilizes LEO store-and-forward satellites in polar orbit.
This system will provide large message and file transfers over 9.6 kilobits per second (kbps) links and offers two basic services: e-mail/fax transmission, and supervisory control and data acquisition.
Local people need to be made aware of the situation and local relief agencies, such as fire or ambulance services, need to be alerted.
If help is organized by international relief agencies, this should also be known to the local population.
There are various methods for broadcasting information to the area affected by a disaster.
It is possible, for example, to receive information directly from a satellite or for messages to be passed via cellular networks.
However, the equipment to receive such information is normally only available to relatively prosperous sections of the community and as a result the coverage would be somewhat uneven.
The most commonly available receiving equipment is the transistor radio.
It has been estimated that there are over two billion radios in use, with nearly half of those being in the developing countries.
A system that could address a large proportion of these radios seems to have the best chance of achieving a high penetration.
Broadcasting directly to these receivers must be done by terrestrial means.
This can most conveniently and economically be achieved by use of the FM/VHF bands of frequencies, for which most transistor radios are already equipped.
Distribution of the signal to the area concerned is most conveniently carried out by satellite.
Existing satellite capacity is available and can be leased for this purpose.
The receiving equipment for the satellite signal can be a relatively simple receive-only Earth station with a 2.4 m antenna and a 64 kbps link.
WMO already uses such a system and it can easily be extended for disaster applications.
The information received by the station can be disseminated directly to the local population through transistor radios or directed to the local emergency services, as appropriate.
Each receiver/transmitter combination has a coverage area of 40 kms in diameter in flat terrain.
D. Use of data from remote sensing satellites
Remote sensing has become an important source of geographic information on current land cover and land use needed for rational development and sustainable management of agricultural and forestry resources and for environmental protection.
Users have to compromise to fit their information requirements to the parameters of available remote sensing data.
Furthermore, the countries that have the most pressing need for remote sensing do not have the resources to build the necessary capacities for its efficient use.
The increasing volumes of image data that are generated or the number of image products that are sold should not be used as a measure to gauge the success of satellite remote sensing.
The ultimate criterion of its success will be the extent to which remote sensing will have contributed to the quality of life on Earth.
Greater international effort should made to apply new remote sensing and GIS capacities where they are needed most: for monitoring environmental degradation and for implementing programmes for the sustainable management of natural resources in order to safeguard them for future generations.
Particular attention should be given to the needs of developing countries and to strengthening their national remote sensing and GIS capacities.
The Regional Remote Sensing Project (RRSP) of FAO is a component of the Early Warning System for the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) region.
Output from this project is fed into the combined physical and socio-economic data used by the Regional Early Warning Unit (REWU) and the Household Food Security Project.
The main objective of the present phase of the project is to strengthen national and regional capabilities in the area of remote sensing for early warning and food security by the establishment of an operational information system.
As such, RRSP is developing national capacities for the analysis and interpretation of coarse-resolution satellite imagery and for the subsequent generation of information products.
At present, satellite data processed by the project and the resulting information products are sent to the contact points and a number of users in the SADC region using mail courier services.
The current phase of the project will see specific attention being given to the transfer of the processing technology to the principal contact points in the countries.
To support this, e-mail links are being established between RRSP, REWU and meteorological services in the SADC countries.
Finally, the project will establish a low-cost integrated satellite data acquisition system for NOAA and METEOSAT data in Harare.
Geologists, engineers, industrialists and planners are now more frequently using remote sensing in the evaluation of hazard situations.
In hazard prevention studies, the interpretation of satellite data together with the analysis of geological records make it possible to reconstruct a historical overview of the occurrence of damaging events.
This information can be used statistically to make a prognosis of potential risk in the occurrence of a catastrophe or for the production of thematic maps that show the spatial context in which hazards occur.
Remote sensing is not only used in preventive studies, but also in the monitoring of dynamic geological processes such as terrain deformation, neotectonic activities and flooding.
Recently, a new technique using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite data, called radar interferometry, has been introduced in the analysis of vertical displacement associated with fault movements.
On 17 July 1991, ESA launched the first European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS-1), a polar orbiting satellite that constituted a major development in remote sensing applications by providing new tools for assisting in natural disasters monitoring and relief.
ERS-2 was launched on 21 April 1995 in order to ensure continuity of data acquisition.
However, since ERS-1 is still fully operational, the two satellites are operated by ESA in a tandem mode that provides a unique opportunity for several applications.
The two ERS satellites provide a wealth of radar information for many applications.
They are both equipped with several microwave sensors as well as an optical radiometer.
The main radar equipment is the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which can be operated in an imaging mode as a side-looking SAR, thereby providing high-resolution image data in C-band (5.3 GHz) at regional scales.
Because microwave radiation suffers very little attenuation in passing through clouds and rainfall (except very heavy thunderstorms), the ERS-1 and ERS-2 SARs provide images of the tropical areas that heretofore could not be thoroughly mapped with LANDSAT and SPOT because of the constant presence of clouds in the region.
Furthermore, the complementarity between optical and radar images of the same area has already proven to be an excellent and powerful tool for advanced applications and an asset in natural disaster monitoring and relief.
On a global scale, the ERS-1 AMI SAR is operated as a wave scatterometer over water to generate SAR "imagettes" of 6 km x 5 km along the SAR swath at 200 km intervals.
Through the analysis of the imagette spectrum, operational worldwide information on the wave systems, namely wave height and wave direction, is derived.
Such products are disseminated within three hours from data sensing to nominated centres through the global meteorological network for subsequent assimilation into numerical analysis and forecast models.
The ERS-1 AMI can also be operated as a wind scatterometer to provide wind vectors at the ocean surface on a 25 km grid.
Sea surface backscattering signals of radar pulses emitted at three different side-looking angles are measured on board and then elaborated on the ground through a C-band model to generate surface vectors with the same accuracy for conventional ground measurements.
Like the ERS SAR wave data, AMI wind vectors are also disseminated operationally through the global telecommunication system.
Data from the ERS wind scatterometer are of particular help in the tropical region, in the southern hemisphere and in the northern Pacific Ocean because of the very limited amount of available statistical data on these areas.
ERS-1 radar altimeter data provide worldwide surface information.
Several measurements are derived at a global scale from backscattered signals of downward emitted radar pulses, including the height of sea and ice surfaces, the height of sea waves and the wind speed at the sea surface.
Additional geodetic and climatological information is generated from the former, which leads to the availability of some important climatic change indicators, such as anomalies in ocean topography (e.g. el Ni√±o and la Ni√±a) or in ice melting (e.g. Antarctic caps).
The precise range and range rate equipment (PRARE), operational on ERS-2, allows precise orbit calculations to be made and accurate corrections to radar altimeter measurements to be implemented.
In addition, ERS satellites carry an along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR), a dual instrument constituted by an optical and a passive microwave radiometer.
The optical radiometer on ERS-1 works in four infrared spectral bands, at 1.6, 3.7, 11 and 12 micrometers; three visible channels have been added to the ERS-2 version.
Very accurate sea surface temperature measurements are provided globally on a 50 km grid, with an intrinsic original 1 km spatial and 0.1 K radiometric resolution.
A dual viewing, oblique at 50 degrees ahead and vertical, together with internal black-body calibration leads to very accurate atmospheric corrections.
The visible channels added to the ERS-2 radiometer allow the derivation of vegetation indices.
The ATSR Microwave Sounder is a dual frequency passive radiometer, whose data are used primarily to correct radar altimeter measurements and to determine the atmospheric vapour content.
High-resolution satellite imagery (HRSI) is an important tool for increasing the efficiency during the planning and implementation phases of refugee work relief operations.
Until recently, the highest resolution satellite images commercially available have been 10 m resolution SPOT images.
Currently, images with 2 m resolution obtained from Russian military satellites are commercially available.
This information can be used to obtain estimates of refugee-camp population, area and growth rates.
The interpretation of such high-resolution images should be strongly linked to the United Nations in order to utilize already established communication lines with relief agencies.
In the near future, sensors with ground resolution down to 1 m will be commercially available.
The data distribution systems of these satellites will be vastly improved in comparison to the present ones.
However, an unfortunate trend might be seen in the data distribution plans of some commercial companies that intend to offer exclusive rights to the customers on a first-come, first-served basis, denying access to the images for late customers.
It is therefore important for the United Nations to play an active role in forming policies to distribute HRSI.
Data from satellite-based radar systems can also be used in many ways for natural hazard reduction.
The most conventional use of radar data is the recognition of flooded areas by the dark signature of still water in a radar image associated with the all-weather capability of the instrument.
The 1 m accuracy of the models created by ERS-1 data is unmatched by other space-based techniques.
The dense spatial samplings (100 pixels/sq km) provided by radar interferometry in the detection of displacements associated with its accuracy (in the range of 3-10 mm) make it an important tool for assessing most natural hazards.
This tool could be used as a cheap warning signal in the case of volcanoes, as was demonstrated in the case of the recent activity at Mount Etna.
The ERS-1 satellite can also provide the data required for global monitoring of all potentially hazardous volcanoes.
Radar interferometry can also contribute to the understanding of earthquakes, especially in poorly equipped areas because it does not require ground instrumentation.
Some current limitations of these techniques are linked to the physics of the atmosphere, the contribution of which can only be separated by the analysis of multiple image pairs and the change of the surface state in long periods of time that spoils the interference patterns.
A high throughput system such as ERS-1 proved capable of delivering the many images required.
Other limitations come from the features of current space-borne radar instruments, which were not designed for this purpose.
The experience gained could be of help when designing better systems in the future.
However, the built-in design margins of ERS-1 permit its operational use in the field of interferometry, for which it was not initially designed.
E. A global monitoring and warning satellite system
The Japanese Space Agency, NASDA, is emphasizing the development of data analysis technology for a variety of applications including natural disaster reduction.
For the development of technology for data application in the field of natural disaster reduction, NASDA is considering cooperative research projects, such as the Global Earth Observation System (GEOS), the Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS), and the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), with the international user community for the verification of algorithms to be applied to actual case-studies.
NASDA is also planning to reflect user requirements in the field of natural disaster reduction to future programmes.
The purpose of the World Environment and Disaster Observation System (WEDOS) and the Global Disaster Observation System (GDOS) of the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies, Inc. is to provide continuous operational monitoring of the Earth's environment in order to detect and mitigate natural disasters and human-induced accidents.
A total of 26 remote sensing satellites will be launched into low altitude, sun synchronous and circular orbits together with 12 (6 in-orbit spares) data relay satellites in geostationary orbit.
The monitoring of short-term changes is indispensable to the prevention of disasters and that type of monitoring could be accomplished by using existing technologies.
Both systems therefore concentrate on observing environmental changes that occur over short periods (e.g. oil pollution and red tides) and the simultaneous observation of phenomena occurring globally over the surface of Earth (e.g. wind speed and direction of sea surface).
Consequently, any location in the world could be observed by WEDOS at least once a day with 20 m resolution; therefore irregularities and environmental changes can be detected immediately.
More precise observations of the damaged areas, with 2 m resolution, will also be possible several times a day.
GDOS is a modified version of WEDOS, which facilitates the location of disasters and is capable of repeatedly observing a disaster site.
The payloads of the satellite segment of both systems would be designed to monitor the land and ocean environment, the geosphere, hydrosphere and meteorological conditions, with the aid of visible, near infrared, microwave, short-wave and thermal radiometers, synthetic aperture radar, radar altimeter and scattering lidar.
The ground segment would comprise a mission management centre, satellite control centres, a master ground station and local user stations.
Observation data would be received by the master ground station via data relay satellites and would then be recorded and processed.
The processed data would be distributed to each local user station in the world.
To implement any of these two systems it is mandatory to develop an international consensus on the importance of the subject of disasters and to gain support from the general public, scientific community, governmental and United Nations entities that are in charge of the natural environment and disaster prevention.

COMMITTEE ON THE PEACEFUL USES OF OUTER SPACE
MICROSATELLITES AND SMALL SATELLITES: CURRENT PROJECTS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVES FOR INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
Note by the Secretariat
The Working Group of the Whole to Evaluate the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82), at its eighth session (A/AC.105/571, annex II, para. 17), proposed that several studies on space applications should be undertaken by the Office for Outer Space Affairs in view of the recommendations adopted at the workshops, seminars, symposia and conferences organized by the United Nations Programme on Space Applications.
The Working Group of the Whole identified a number of possible subjects for such studies, including microsatellites and small satellites, current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation.
The report of the Working Group of the Whole was adopted by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session (A/AC.105/571, para. 22), and the recommendations contained therein were endorsed by the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in its report on the work of its thirty-seventh session1 and by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994.
The present study has been prepared by the Secretariat in response to the request of the Working Group of the Whole.
The study, which is available in English only, is presented in the annex to the present note.
The purpose of the study was to give an overview of the rapidly evolving field of small satellites, which should be easily accessible even to countries with limited or newly conceived space programmes.
The study was prepared using a variety of national and international sources that are listed in the selected bibliography at the end of the study.
It was also sent in draft form to external experts for comments.
A summary of the study is provided below.
SUMMARY OF THE STUDY Small satellites have already been used with considerable success by many organizations.
Their attraction lies in the promise of low-cost and short development time, which is made possible by the use of proven standard equipment and techniques, together with a realistic expectation of performance.
The space age began with the launching of small scientific satellites in 1958, the International Geophysical Year. Those satellites were small because of the limited capacity of the first space launchers.
After a modest beginning with small, simple and lightweight satellites, space systems evolved into large, complex and expensive space platforms for scientific research and other applications that often require many years of development prior to launch.
While such large platforms exist and will continue to exist, there has recently been a growing interest in returning to the use of small satellites, which can be launched within a few years after programme initiation.
As a consequence of the evolution of space-related technologies, this class of spacecraft can make significant space capabilities accessible to a wide number of users, ranging from students in secondary schools and universities to engineers and scientists in every country in the world.
In many ways, projects involving small satellites are ideal for extensive international cooperation.
The development of small satellites will not replace that of large satellites, as the goals and issues involved are often different.
Missions involving small satellites can, however, be a complement to large satellite missions.
By exploring new methods and techniques, small satellites can be a tool for pioneering experiments and technologies for future missions involving larger satellites.
Small satellites have several advantages over large satellites and these hold true no matter who the users are: more frequent, and a larger variety of, mission opportunities; more rapid expansion of the technical knowledge base; greater involvement of local industry; and greater diversification of potential users.
Moreover, even a country with a modest research budget and little or no experience with space technology can afford to participate in missions involving small satellites.
Small satellites also offer excellent opportunities for training students, engineers and scientists in different disciplines, including engineering, software development for computers on board and on the ground and management of sophisticated technical programmes.
Recent technological progress in many areas means that small satellites can offer services previously only available from much larger satellites.
Fairly sophisticated scientific and technological experiments, as well as application missions, can be flown in space at modest costs.
The areas of application include: space physics, astronomy, astrophysics, technology demonstrations, communications experiments and acquisition of Earth resource data, including disaster information.
The definition of a small satellite varies, but an upper limit of about 400 kg (in exceptional cases 500 kg) is usually adopted, within which there are two main categories: small satellites (or minisatellites), which weigh about 100-400 kg; and microsatellites, which weigh less than 100 kg.
A typical "small satellite mission", including launch, generally costs less than US$ 20 million and most microsatellite projects cost approximately US$ 3 million.
A central issue in any small satellite mission is the optimum balance between programme complexity and risk.
Small satellites are likely to offer new opportunities for procurement methods.
The selected model philosophies are important in terms of both risk and cost and, as a maximum, a protoflight approach is acceptable for such programmes.
The advantages of small satellites are as follows:
(a) Orbital parameters optimized to individual instrument requirements;
(b) Augmentation of conventional satellite programmes, such as additional capability, redundancy for critical missions, or replacement of a failed instrument;
(c) Missions with limited lifetime and/or coverage requirements;
(d) Improved responsiveness to the end-user (more frequent launch opportunities and increased mission flexibility for individual instruments, plus schedule independence);
(e) Quick-reaction, launch-on-demand launches using low-cost dedicated vehicles (e.g. crisis monitoring, replacement after an in-orbit failure, or monitoring of unexpected environmental conditions);
(f) Relaxed reliability owing to the shorter lifetime or agreed, lower levels of product assurance or lower-quality parts as appropriate to lower development costs;
(g) Reduced satellite design complexity (e.g. simplified interfaces, optimized for instrument requirements), shorter development schedule and suitable test-bed for proving technique and/or technology.
There are three general classes of orbit that may be suitable for small satellites: the geostationary orbit (GSO), the highly elliptical orbit (HEO) and the low Earth orbit (LEO).
GSO is where the satellite appears fixed relative to the ground, thus allowing continuous visibility and simplifying the ground segment and operational requirements.
Because of the large space-to-ground distance involved, however, the data rates are small, or larger ground antennas and higher electrical power on board the spacecraft are required.
This orbit is usually reached from a standard geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) provided by a large launch vehicle.
The use of GTO is interesting as it could benefit from frequent piggyback launch opportunities while avoiding the complexity and extra costs associated with an apogee propulsion system.
LEO is generally preferred for small satellite missions.
Small launch vehicles may be used, offering flexibility in the selection of the orbit parameters; piggyback launches may also be used.
A low-energy transmitter on board is sufficient because of the short distance from the ground, but infrequent and short visibility periods are a drawback, leading to some ground-segment and operational complexity.
A distinction should be made between the near equatorial or low inclination orbits, for which the visibility zone will be limited to the topical zone, and the polar and quasi-polar (Sun-synchronous) orbits that allow accessibility to any point on Earth, either for communication (e.g. store and forward) or for remote sensing of Earth.
The current and future development of small satellites is closely linked to the appearance of new, low-cost launchers (Pegasus, Taurus etc.) and lower-cost launch opportunities on existing vehicles (for example, Ariane-4 or small canisters on the Space Shuttle).
The potential availability of cheap launchers has spurred much of the recent surge of interest in small satellites, which was initially driven largely by defence and global civil communication programmes of the United States of America.
Of the major low-cost launchers of European countries and the United States, only Pegasus and Taurus are flight-proven.
Conestoga is planned for flight in the near future, development of the Italian San Marco Scout has not yet started (although its forerunner, the United States Scout, has been operated for many years) and the Ariane-5 derivative programme should be completed in 1999.
In order to maximize their potential, small launcher developers must apply the same innovative, low-cost design approach used on small satellites.
Launch costs represent a large portion of total programme costs (generally over 25 per cent) and satellite mass and size must therefore be constrained to take full advantage of low-cost launch opportunities.
Options include:
(a) Small dedicated launchers;
(b) Multiple launch of several small satellites, nominally on Ariane-4 or Ariane-5 for European missions (e.g. Cluster scientific satellites of the European Space Agency (ESA));
(c) Flight opportunities on larger launchers (Arianespace has strongly promoted its vehicles for this purpose, with Ariane-4 offering: Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP) for piggyback microsatellites (up to six 50 kg satellites (300 kg total)); Ariane Radioamateur Satellite Enseignement Espace (ARSENE)-type configuration for satellites of up to 200 kg; and SPELDA Dedicated Satellite (SDS) for satellites in the range of 400-800 kg within the short Ariane Dual Launch External Bearing Structure (SPELDA) adapter.
Similar options are provided by other medium-sized or large launchers, for example, the United States Atlas Centaur and the Delta-2.
Requirements for the ground segment of a small satellite system vary enormously depending on the application area.
At one extreme, low data rate sensors with only local or regional coverage on missions with low tracking and command requirements impose relatively low demands on the ground segment, possibly comprising only 10 per cent or less of total programme costs.
More complex data retrieval and processing requirements could result in ground segment costs of up to 50 per cent of total programme costs.
Assuming that ground segment costs tend to average 25 per cent of total programme costs, it is clearly important to identify potential savings in the ground segment in concert with those of the space segment.
In attempting to reduce the ground segment costs, there are limits on simplification because it is still necessary to ensure the achievement of capabilities such as reliable operation, rapid response to critical commands and regular form of data on time and with low loss. The ground segment model, which forms the basis of any technical and cost assessments, must include not just the provision of the ground stations, but also ground communications infrastructure, mission control etc.
Very small, in some cases transportable, stations have been made commercially available by several suppliers in European countries and in the United States.
Commercial providers of remote sensing data are likely to press for the adoption of such approaches in attempts to reduce the cost of distributing and processing the data.
Space science activities are obviously valuable, and most space-faring nations have begun their involvement in this field with small scientific satellites.
The first small scientific satellite of Argentina will be the Scientific Applications Satellite (SAC-B), which is being developed jointly by its national space agency, the National Commission for Space Activities (CONAE), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States.
The 190 kg satellite is to be launched in 1996 by a Pegasus rocket into a circular orbit of 550 km with an inclination of 37 degrees.
SAC-B will be inertially stabilized and permanently oriented to the Sun.
It will monitor energetic X-rays from solar flares and survey the sky with X-ray charge-coupled device (CCD) sensors along an axis perpendicular to the Sun line.
Between 1978 and 1991, scientific microsatellites weighing 15-50 kg were developed for the Magnetosphere-Ionosphere (MAGION) research programme in the former Czechoslovakia.
MAGION-1 was launched on 24 October 1978 as a subsatellite of the INTERCOSMOS-18 geophysical satellite.
Although it was designed for an operational lifetime of three weeks, MAGION-1 remained operational for three years.
MAGION-2 and MAGION-3 were launched into high-inclination low-eccentricity orbits (with an altitude of 500-3,200 km) as part of the ACTIVE and Ariane Passengers Experiment (APEX) mother-daughter active space missions launched on 28 September 1989 and on 18 December 1991, respectively.
The MAGION-4 subsatellite was successfully launched by a Molniya launcher from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk, Russian Federation, on 3 August 1995, as part of the INTERBALL-tail mission.
MAGION-5 is currently scheduled for a 1996 launch.
The Central European Satellite for Advanced Research (CESAR) is a spacecraft of about 300 kg that will fly in an orbit with a perigee of 400 km, an apogee of 1,000 km and an inclination of 70 degrees.
The scientific mission is related to the study of the magnetosphere, ionosphere and thermosphere of Earth.
This mission is one of the objectives of the cooperation among the countries of the Central European Initiative.
Space industry and research institutions in Finland have acquired experience in satellite payloads and instrumentation through their associate membership in ESA and have long been active in remote sensing and other space-related disciplines.
To initiate a study of a Finnish small satellite (FS-1), Finnish institutes defined their interests by contacting selected institutes with an unofficial announcement of opportunity and by asking for proposals.
After the proposal phase, system design was performed for two alternatives: a scientific satellite and an Earth observation satellite.
Each satellite would contain a technology demonstration package in which new electronic components would be tested in the space environment.
The French National Centre for Space Studies (CNES) is currently considering the following small scientific satellites:
(a) Mission SAMBA: registration of the local fluctuations of 3 kelvin radiation from the big bang (similar to the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite of the United States) and detailed measurement of possible anisotropies;
(b) Mission COROT: astroseismology, new data on the convection and internal rotation of stars by long-term measurement of stellar oscillations;
(c) Mission IBIZA: registration of the plasma accelerated in the geomagnetic auroral regions, interaction of ionized particles with the ionosphere and magnetosphere of Earth, creation of electromagnetic disturbances;
(d) QUICK-STEP: verification of the equivalence of the inertial and gravitational mass (theory of relativity) with a relative precision of 10-17.
On 3 February 1994, the small satellite of the University of Bremen, BREMSAT, was carried into orbit by the United States Space Shuttle Discovery.
The spacecraft, which weighed 63 kg, waited six days in its Get Away Special (GAS) container before it was deployed into its initial circular orbit of 350 km.
The satellite carried six experiments with different scientific objectives, including heat conductivity under microgravity, micrometeorite and dust particle distribution, atmospheric atomic oxygen mapping and re-entry pressures and temperatures.
The satellite functioned until its in-orbit decay on 12 February 1995.
In developing its indigenous launching capacity, India prepared a series of small technology development and scientific satellites called Rohini and the Stretched Rohini Scientific Satellite (SROSS) series.
The Rohini satellites were launched between 1980 and 1983 and carried a landmark sensor payload including a solid state camera.
More than 2,500 frames in both visible and infrared bands for identification of landmarks and altitude and orbit refinement were obtained. The orbital mass of the Rohini satellites was about 42 kg.
SROSS-C and SROSS-C2 were launched on 20 May 1992 and 4 May 1994, respectively.
They each carry two scientific payloads.
The first is the retarding potential analyser, consisting of two planar detectors to measure plasma parameters and to investigate the energetic structure of the equatorial ionosphere.
The second is the gamma-ray burst experiment, consisting of two scintillation detectors to study celestial gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20-3,000 kilo-electronvolts.
The Instituto Nacional de Tecnica Aeroespacial (INTA) of Spain, situated at Torrej√≥n de Ardoz, has been entrusted by the Government with the direction of a research project for the development of a Spanish space system, called MINISAT.
The system will consist of a multi-purpose platform (service module), payload module and an associated ground segment.
Both the platform and the subsystems comprising it are modular in character.
The platform will be capable of receiving, integrating, operating and carrying on board a payload module by means of standard interfaces.
This will permit all the required adaptations for a particular mission to be easily conducted.
The platform will be able to carry payloads with masses that vary between 80 and 500 kg.
The first of these satellites will be a MINISAT mission carrying a payload module (PLM-1).
The first Swedish-built satellite was the 283 kg Viking, which was launched into low polar orbit in 1986 in a piggyback configuration with the French remote sensing satellite, satellite pour l'observation de la Terre (SPOT).
The scientific objective of the Viking satellite was to study ionospheric and magnetospheric phenomena at high geomagnetic latitudes in the altitude region of up to about two Earth radii.
A more advanced small scientific satellite, called Freja, was launched on 6 October 1992 by a Chinese launcher.
This satellite of 214 kg is designed for auroral research and other related magnetospheric phenomena.
Because Swedish magnetospheric scientists are very interested in the possibilities of small satellites, a compact satellite platform has been developed that is 10 per cent of the mass of the Freja.
This new microsatellite, called Astrid, is shaped like a box with sides measuring approximately 50 x 50 cm and has a mass of 25 kg in its stowed configuration.
It is spin-stabilized with a Sun-pointing capability and deployable solar panels.
The first Astrid was launched on 24 January 1995 from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk on a Cosmos launcher.
The best example of the small satellite programmes in the United States is the NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) programme, which provides for frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and relatively inexpensive science missions.
Each SMEX spacecraft weighs approximately 250 kg and each mission is expected to cost approximately US$ 50 million for design, development and 30 days of in-orbit operations.
The first satellite of this series, the Solar, Anomalous and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX), was launched on 3 July 1992.
It has been successfully investigating the composition of local interstellar matter and solar material and the transport of magnetospheric charged particles into the atmosphere of Earth.
The Submillimeter-Wave Astronomy Satellite (SWAS) is to be launched on a Pegasus rocket in 1995 or 1996.
Probably the most experienced research unit in the field of microsatellites is the Spacecraft Engineering Research Unit at the University of Surrey in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.
Since 1981, UOSAT and, more recently, the Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL) team have logged over 25 orbit-years of microsatellite operations.
A total of 10 University of Surrey Satellite Project (UOSAT) satellites were launched between 1981 and 1993.
The operational microsatellite S-80/T, which is based upon the UOSAT platform, was launched in August 1992 with a mission objective to explore communication possibilities of the very high frequency World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC-92) bands allocated to non-geostationary satellite systems.
The initial mission objective has been successfully achieved.
S-80/T completed its first operational year in October 1993 while continuing its flawless functioning.
Amateur satellites of the UOSAT series are capable of transmitting images of the surface of Earth, as well as meteorological data.
The latest additions to the UOSAT family are a Portuguese satellite (POSAT-1), HEALTHSAT-2 and KITSAT-2, which were launched together in September 1993 aboard Ariane V-59, together with the SPOT-3 commercial remote sensing satellite.
POSAT is the result of close cooperation between SSTL Satellite and a Portuguese industrial consortium.
KITSAT-2 was built in the Republic of Korea by engineers trained by SSTL.
Its platform retains many similarities with S-80/T and KITSAT-1 (launched in August 1992), while some payloads have been developed by engineers of the Republic of Korea.
On 9 February 1993, a Pegasus launcher launched the first Brazilian data collection satellite (SCD-1) with an inclination of 25 degrees and an altitude of 750 km.
SCD-1, designed and built by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) is a small spin-stabilized satellite dedicated to the collection and distribution of environmental data acquired and emitted by data-collecting platforms over Brazilian territory.
Since its launching, SCD-1 has been performing excellently.
The first satellite of an Italian data collection satellite series called the Telespazio Micro Satellite (TEMISAT) was launched by a Russian Tsiklon launcher from the cosmodrome at Plesetsk on 31 August 1993, together with a Meteor-2 satellite.
The satellite is orbiting the Earth at an altitude of 950 km and with an inclination of 82.5 degrees and an orbital eccentricity of less than 0.0001.
A second unit (TEMISAT-2) was manufactured together with the first one; it is stored on the ground and could be launched to increase the in-orbit service capacity.
Applied to Earth observation missions, small satellites can be utilized independently to fulfil the function of specific payload instruments.
Several can be flown in a constellation to replace or augment the functions of a larger multi-instrumented satellite.
Small satellites will not entirely replace such large platforms, which offer both financial and scientific benefits, such as economies of scale and synergy of measurements.
In addition, large satellites are essential where specific instruments must be large enough to achieve their mission objectives with high power and very high data rates (e.g. depending on the size of radar antenna or optical performance on aperture and focal length).
Potentially suitable Earth observation missions for small satellites include: global ocean sampling (by a constellation of satellites); geophysical sampling (by a single satellite in polar orbit); ocean and coastal zone colour monitoring; single instrument payload in support of larger missions, commercial mapping and land surveys; crisis and/or disaster monitoring (e.g. floods, forest fires, oil spills), launched on demand or into a constellation; and vegetation monitoring for agriculture and forestry.
The recurrent orbit Earth observation satellite project of Japan provides an example of a small satellite that is being used for remote sensing purposes.
By using a recurrent orbit (with a repeating ground track every fifteenth revolution), the observation frequency of the area is greatly improved.
This is the origin of the Domestic Urban Area Observation Satellite (DUOS) concept.
The DUOS system is based on the Optical Intersatellite Communications Engineering Test Satellite, which is currently scheduled to be launched by the J-1 in 1998.
It will have a three-axis stabilized bus with two panels of solar arrays and batteries.
Within the given mass limit, the satellite could carry the Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer and a thermal infrared radiometer.
The long-term goal of the Technical University of Berlin Satellite (TUBSAT) programme is the development of a three-axis stabilized observation platform that can be autonomously oriented to any desired direction with arc minute accuracy.
Of primary interest is the remote sensing of Earth, so that precise stabilization is required both for observation and for a high data transmission rate to permit real-time or almost real-time reception of the pictures.
These goals are being approached in several steps.
Based on the orbital experience of TUBSAT-A and TUBSAT-B, launched in 1991 and 1994, respectively, instrumentation of the third spacecraft will also include three fibre optic laser gyroscopes.
A preliminary structure of TUBSAT-C has already been manufactured and is being used for three-axis air bearing experiments.
The pre-operational Fire Reconnaissance System (FIRES), recently studied in Germany, will demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of a future operational small satellite system for fire reconnaissance.
It is anticipated to be of use not only for pure detection of a fire event in large areas, but also for its ability to locate the fire, assess the extent (in space and time) and type of the fire and provide this information to local authorities in a timely manner.
In addition to this primary task, the system should be able to solve secondary problems such as assessment of vegetation damage, assessment of atmospheric pollution and evaluation of the revitalization of burned areas.
Furthermore, when the satellite is not over vegetated areas, its sensor system can contribute to other remote sensing tasks related to high temperature detection.
A satellite health network has been proposed for western Africa by a non-profit agency in the United States, Volunteers in Technology Assistance, using a constellation of small LEO communication satellites to link regional medical centres with village clinics and mobile health teams.
Where it would be more economical to do so, two-way radio-telephones would be used to link villages or mobile units to local clinics, which in turn would be linked to a regional centre via satellite.
It has been estimated that 10 microsatellites could be built and launched for about US$ 21 million, while about US$ 30 million would be required for the medical facilities and the Earth station network.
Such a system could dramatically improve the access of rural people to good medical care.
If successful, the experiment would serve as a model for other remote regions.
The recent availability of relatively low-cost launch opportunities has made it conceivable for educational institutions to develop, manufacture, test and operate a small satellite.
There is always an emphasis on the active participation of members of the university community (professors, students, postgraduates), which gives them invaluable practical experience with space technology and scientific research.
For example, the first Spanish microsatellite, UPM/SAT 1, with a mass of 47 kg, has been designed and manufactured by the Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid.
It is a low-cost platform with a moderately long operational life capable of future evolution.
It was launched on 7 July 1995 as an auxiliary payload of the Ariane-40 rocket carrying the French Helios-1A satellite.
The main experiment on the satellite comprises monitoring of the behaviour of a fluid configuration called liquid bridge in microgravity conditions.
Developing a moderately complex design in a university environment should allow professors and students to get the experience necessary for more complex projects.
The Sunset satellite being developed by graduate students in electronic engineering at Stellenbosch University in South Africa is planned for launch early in 1996.
It is a microsatellite weighing 50 kg that is compatible with an Ariane launcher and is capable of three-colour stereo imaging of Earth.
Pictures can be transmitted in real time or stored on the satellite.
The attitude of the satellite can be controlled within 1 milliradian.
The communications package includes an S-band downlink and amateur radio store and forward communications with an audio repeater to stimulate radio interest among schoolchildren.
The opportunities for small and medium-sized countries to enter into space activities at a relevant level have, in the past, been limited.
In the past decade, however, technological advances in materials and microelectronics, together with the experience gained, have allowed many significant space missions to be performed with small satellites.
In recognition of the importance of this trend for international cooperation in outer space, the International Academy of Astronautics, at its meeting in August 1992, elevated the status of its subcommittee on small satellite programmes to the status of a full committee.
At the same time, a new subcommittee on small satellites for developing nations was created under the auspices of the committee.
It will act as a liaison with the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, the International Space University and the International Astronautical Federation, particularly with its Committee for Liaison with International Organizations and Developing Nations.
The long-term goals of the new subcommittee are to promote the use of small satellites for the benefit of developing countries.
An assessment of these benefits is made on a regional basis, starting with the situation in Latin America.
Each assessment is to be prepared during a workshop organized by the subcommittee with representatives of interested countries.
The resulting reports will be published and will serve as a basis for further action.
The first regional workshop was held at S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, Brazil, on 20 to 23 June 1994 at the invitation of INPE.
The eventual success of small satellites and microsatellites is not considered to be in doubt; however, before the full potential of these emerging technologies can be realized, it will be necessary to radically rethink the way missions are specified, realized, funded and operated.
The changing role of international cooperation to this effect should be further explored.
Because of the diverse nature of both applications and instruments, their needs are unlikely to be met with a common small satellite bus design, but more intensive exchange of experience with different designs could eventually lead to some kind of standardization.
The ability to adapt existing hardware readily and cheaply will also be a valuable economic asset for both manufacturer and user.
Among the main difficulties in promoting the use of small satellite technology for developing countries is the fact that the countries with established space programmes frequently do not understand the scope of problems within developing countries and that there is a lack of adequately trained local personnel.
In this context, it would be extremely valuable if the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space would pay more attention to this issue.
It is therefore pertinent that the theme fixed for special attention by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-third session is "Utilization of microsatellites and small satellites for the expansion of low-cost activities, taking into account the special needs of developing countries".
Based on the results of its deliberations on this special theme, as well as on recommendations contained in the present report, the Committee might propose some ways and means of ensuring substantial progress in international cooperation in this rapidly developing field.
For example, it might recommend that one or more of the educational activities of the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should be devoted to the theme of microsatellites and small satellites.

A. Background and objectives The General Assembly, in its resolution 37/90 of 10 December 1982, endorsed the recommendations of the Second United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNISPACE 82) that the United Nations Programme on Space Applications should promote the growth of indigenous nuclei and an autonomous technological base in space technology for developing countries.
At its thirty-eighth session, in June 1994, the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications for 1995, as recommended by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee at its thirty-first session.
Subsequently, the General Assembly, in resolution 49/34 of 9 December 1994, endorsed the activities of the Programme on Space Applications for 1995.
The present report contains a summary of the proceedings of the United Nations/International Astronautical Federation Workshop on Space Technology for Health Care and Environmental Monitoring in the Developing World.
Previous symposia and workshops in the series have been held in Austria, Canada, Israel and the United States of America.
The main objective of the Workshop was to provide participants with information on the possibilities offered by current space technologies and to discuss ways in which they could be used in ongoing or planned programmes and projects of the participants.
During the course of the Workshop successful models of space applications were presented.
Through panel discussions, the Workshop developed general principles on how developing countries could use space technologies, including remote sensing and space communications systems for health care, environmental monitoring and economic and social development.
The present report covering the background, objectives and organization of the Workshop, as well as the observations and recommendations made by the participants, has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants will report to the appropriate authorities in their own countries. B. Participants
The United Nations invited developing countries to participate in the Workshop.
Participants were required to have university degrees in engineering, physics, biological or medical sciences or other fields related to the themes of the Workshop.
The participants were working in programmes, projects or enterprises in which space technology could be utilized.
A few policy makers, at a decision-making level, from both national and international entities were also invited.
Funds allocated by the United Nations, IAF and the other co-sponsors for the Workshop were used to cover international air travel and per diem expenses for the period of the Workshop and the IAF Congress for selected participants from developing countries.
The following Member States and international organizations were represented at the Workshop: Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Costa Rica, Cuba, Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Jordan, Mauritania, Mauritius, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Peru, Philippines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Syrian Arab Republic, Thailand, Togo, Uganda and Viet Nam; Office for Outer Space Affairs of the United Nations and World Health Organization (WHO); and Commission of the European Communities, European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), European Space Agency, European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (EUTELSAT), International Astronautical Federation, International Mobile Satellite Organization (Inmarsat), International Space University (ISU) and International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (INTELSAT).
Speakers, chairmen and participants from Austria, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America also took part in the Workshop. I. PRESENTATIONS AND DISCUSSIONS DURING THE WORKSHOP
A. General themes The Workshop featured a series of presentations on relevant space application fields by experts from both developed and developing countries.
A representative from each of the developing countries presented outlines of its national programme.
Three panel discussions preceded open discussion sessions where the participants interacted, providing information, comments, questions, recommendations and suggestions.
It was stressed repeatedly during the meeting that the problem with adopting space technology in developing countries was not with the technology itself, which existed and was readily available.
The problems were regulatory, legal, political, institutional, financial and educational.
It was suggested that a future UN/IAF workshop might focus on that matter and make recommendations to reduce those problems.
The value of space technology to developing countries was clearly recognized by the participants, as was the necessity for stronger regional cooperation and collaboration.
It was also recognized that there was a strong need for more extensive education in the benefits of space technology at all levels, from school children to political leaders.
In particular, school children should be taught subjects related to space science and technology which were most likely to be relevant to the country in future.
Space technology had become an increasingly vital part of everyday life, characterized by growing costs and complexity, which meant that most developing countries must be extremely selective about the scope and pace of their own space activities.
It had been realized that space technology could be a valuable tool for enhancing international security.
For example, a proposal for the use of a constellation of geosynchronous equatorial and polar orbiting satellites, the Global Satellite Network for Education, Tele-health and Disaster Management (GLOSNETAD), was outlined.
GLOSNETAD would be connected by a network of ground stations as a global arrangement for education, health care and disaster management,
The ever-increasing cost of space technologies and participation in space activities made international cooperation absolutely necessary for many countries wishing to benefit from the technology.
The need for international cooperation was therefore repeatedly stressed.
Space technology provided entirely new dimensions to the way in which health care and education could be delivered.
Conventional approaches required a face-to-face relation between the patient and the health-care provider.
That generally meant that patients in remote areas had very limited access to high-quality, specialized medical care.
The telephone and two-way radio had improved the situation by permitting audio communication between health-care persons in a remote area and specialists at a major centre.
However, the equitable availability of high-quality medical care depended upon interactive audio-visual communication that could be provided by space communications technology.
Telehealth was the practice of health care using interactive audio, visual and data communication.
It included health-care delivery, diagnosis, consultation, treatment, communication of data and education of both the doctor and the patient.
Recent advances in technology, especially in video storage, processing, retrieval and transmission had helped to bring telehealth within the reach of a much broader community.
Telehealth was based on the fundamental premise that there should be equitable access to quality health care.
The cost of health care was rising everywhere.
As a function of a country's gross national product (GNP), the cost had shown a steady rise over the years.
Expectations of health care also continued to rise.
However, available resources were declining.
Telehealth could slow the rate of cost increases.
Moreover, it could help to achieve the goal of equitable access.
In about 50 projects that had been followed by WHO, it was found that there were significant savings in travel costs of physicians and patients.
Telehealth had been successfully used for pathology, radiology, magnetic resonance imaging, cardiology and further medical consultations.
In China, the direct and active participation of medical universities in the use and promotion of space technology had been critical in public health education and medical instruction in remote areas.
Interactive satellite transmission technology was one of the best and most reliable means of conveying health knowledge to medical workers in rural areas.
Since 1993, the West China University of Medical Sciences had actively participated in developing radio and television programmes providing rural areas with basic information not only on health-care services, but also on epidemic diseases, thereby allowing timely mitigation strategies.
Financial and technological support from developed countries was one of the most important factors in successfully promoting the sharing of benefits of space technology to humankind.
Developing countries should place a higher priority on the active participation in and application of space technology in the fields of health care and education.
They should also improve their health care and educational organizations and infrastructures.
The HealthNet programme was developed in 1989 to cooperatively share information and communications services to support public health and medical research in the developing world.
HealthNet was currently in operation in 15 African and 5 Asian countries.
The original intent was to use low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to reach rural and remote areas.
Five ground stations with a computer, radio and antenna had been established.
The satellites were low cost and could be used for electronic mail, with delivery anywhere in the world within 12 hours.
In an effort to address the problem of the globally unbalanced provision of medical and educational services, participants in the ISU 1994 summer session programme at Barcelona developed a proposal to establish the Global Access to Tele-health and Education System (GATES).
By using advanced communications and information technologies for telehealth and tele-education applications, GATES would improve basic medical care and education on a global scale.
The goal of the GATES project was to reduce inequalities in health and education within countries and between countries by using telecommunications technology.
The unique aspects of the GATES system were that it took a global approach and it had the dual objective of combining health care and education.
The dual approach was justified by the fact that the highest medical and educational needs generally appeared in the same areas.
Furthermore, the basic communications requirements for health care and educational services were very similar.
Students working on that project were especially concerned with minimizing costs and keeping the infrastructure as simple as possible.
They recognized that the largest problems were economic and political.
An efficient management structure was proposed.
Membership would be open to any country, but services would be available to anyone, regardless of membership.
GATES would not only be used for health and education services, but also for environmental and disaster management applications.
The United Nations and other international organizations could influence policies that would result in the development of telehealth, distance education systems and further networks where they were needed.
Current and future satellite systems could do much to rectify the gross knowledge imbalance that existed in many parts of the world.
Regulatory, legal and political issues must be addressed and resolved if support services for health care and education were to be met.
Those issues should not be permitted to inhibit the development of essential worldwide satellite services that were feasible.
Presentations on remote sensing focused on the opportunities for using satellite data for environmental monitoring.
It was stated that developing countries would be able to utilize new developments in remote sensing systems to gain access to significantly greater quantities of valuable data.
Presentations highlighted applications in areas such as forestry, geology and mineral resources, cartography and other fields.
It was emphasized that compared with conventional ground surveys, satellite observations provided less detail but much greater economy, particularly when continuous and repetitive monitoring was required.
Although the European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellite system of ESA was not specifically planned to meet the needs of developing countries, its data played a vital role, in particular in the fields of environmental monitoring, food production and climate change.
In that context it was emphasized that national aid agencies should substantially increase the use of satellite data in projects funded by them.
They required, however, greater awareness of the potential of space technology for sustainable development.
Aid for food production and preservation of the environment was important not only for humanitarian reasons, but also because it benefits all the donors by cost savings and improved effectiveness in managing emergencies; it also contributed to world political stability.
Space agencies benefited from involvement in aid projects in fields such as education by generating increased public and political interest and by demonstrating their usefulness in converting general policy statements into technical implementation.
The Workshop identified several areas where cooperation could be improved, such as an assessment of user requirements of the developing countries, accessibility of satellite data and information services at reasonable cost, promotion of well-designed pilot projects to assure transition to ongoing operational status, increased on-site education and training, provision of infrastructures for satellite data acquisition and better use of existing user interfaces.
It was agreed that the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) would be the appropriate forum in which to discuss those issues.
MERCURE, a satellite-based communications capability donated to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) by member States of ESA, was discussed during the Workshop.
Six European countries had provided the space segment and 16 antennas with related hardware and software.
It would provide UNEP with two different networks: subnet A, the backbone, using 7.3 m antennas providing 384 kilobytes per second (kb/s); and subnet B, for remote areas using 2.4 m antennas providing 64 kb/s.
UNEP currently transmitted about 6 million pages of data to approximately 3,000 users.
Telecommunications costs had quadrupled over the past few years to the current level of US$ 4 million annually.
The service based on MERCURE would be much more effective, and the cost to UNEP would be only US$ 6 million over a period of four years.
The backbone system would be based on 64 channels, each of which would have a capacity of 384 kb/s.
Two INTELSAT satellites - one over the Atlantic Ocean and the other over the Indian Ocean - would be used.
The MERCURE system would also provide much wider access to the Internet in Africa, and facilitate much more efficient dissemination of documents, environmental data, images and messages, resulting in substantial savings in telecommunications costs.
The Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by Satellite (TREES) project was sponsored by the Joint Research Centre of the Commission of the European Communities and ESA.
Its main objectives were the development of techniques for a global tropical forest inventory using data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) of the United States of America as well as from the ERS-1 satellite; the development of techniques for the detection and monitoring of active deforestation areas and measuring deforestation rates in critical areas; and the development of a comprehensive Tropical Forest Information System to support the modelling of tropical deforestation dynamics.
The baseline assessment of tropical forest cover using AVHRR had been completed.
Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data over 18 selected areas had been examined with a view to investigating the feasibility of vegetation mapping with ERS-1.
In the future, research methodologies would be tested for monitoring deforestation, and other data sources, such as SPOT and ATSR-2, would be examined.
In 1992, the Panamazonia Project was proposed with the objective of developing a system for monitoring the tropical forest in Latin America using satellite remote sensing. An experienced technical team was selected from agencies in Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Peru and Venezuela.
Visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared images had shown significant environmental damage as a result of deforestation.
It was anticipated that, in the near future, the Panamazonia Project would also provide data on the exploitation of mineral resources.
Considering the magnitude of the losses caused by natural disasters and recognizing the need for a global initiative, the United Nations proclaimed, by resolution 44/236 of 22 December 1989, the 1990s the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction
Whereas natural disasters included floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides and certain types of widely spreading infectious diseases, human-induced disasters included explosions, armed conflicts, motor and aircraft accidents, chemical spills etc.
Forest fires could be of either category.
Space technology offered tremendous potential for assisting in disaster response and mitigation.
Telecommunications satellites addressed issues related to mass awareness, warning, education and training, as well as emergency communication in the event of a disaster.
Remote sensing satellites were useful in formulating disaster mitigation measures and in monitoring, and could assist in risk analyses by promoting understanding of the processes that led to natural disasters.
A national risk assessment system was evolving in India to minimize the harmful effects of hazardous events.
That was a national mission, integrating space applications along with other relevant information for disaster warning, disaster mitigation and efficient management of hazardous events.
Unfortunately, only a few countries had the means to operationally utilize space technology for hazard management.
Increasing access to space technology for such uses could be promoted through appropriate international coordination and cooperation.
Fire was the most common natural cause of forest destruction in Canada.
Several projects were in progress to monitor the extent of such damage.
The most advanced forest management information systems were those currently being used to enhance the effectiveness of fire-suppression activities.
Many of those systems made use of satellite remote-sensing data to categorize the fuel type, which was an important factor in determining the risk that a fire would spread.
Combining the fuel type with other parameters enabled fire-suppression authorities to combat forest fires more effectively, thereby dramatically reducing annual losses and achieving significant savings in fire-suppression costs.
Several projects using remote sensing in North America were related to monitoring forest damage caused by forest fires and insect infestations.
Decision support systems were being developed to provide risk assessment and management planning to minimize losses caused by insects.
In many such projects, remote sensing was used as a tool to acquire information related to damage caused by insects.
Geographic Information Systems (GIS) were used to perform spatial analyses and to produce risk maps in all of those projects.
II. OBSERVATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The importance of merging space technology with other conventional techniques was stressed throughout the Workshop.
The space sector should therefore not be considered in isolation.
Space technology in developing countries should be related to use by the public sector, namely for telecommunications, remote sensing, meteorology and navigation.
Space science should continue to play a vital role, as even a modest investment in that area could pay big dividends.
Space science was well recognized as a valuable contributor to the advancement of technology, particularly in the area of data processing.
Competence in space science contributed to competence in areas far beyond the specific field of research undertaken.
It was agreed that the Workshop would help to increase awareness of the status and possibilities of applications of space technology in developing countries.
However, one impediment to the introduction of space technology in developing countries was the lack of awareness and understanding on the part of political leaders and senior officials, which often resulted in a lack of political will.
To overcome that difficulty, it would be helpful to select a few good people who had been involved in successful programmes as "ambassadors" to developing countries.
Their credibility would probably have a great impact.
It was important to balance space technology with the capabilities and resources of developing countries.
Many aid projects provided expensive technology to developing countries that could not sustain such systems after the initial project was concluded.
Fundamentally, every country must have its own policy to initiate and integrate space projects into its national programmes.
It was recommended that a step-by-step approach be taken to the introduction of space technology.
Although there was already a large market in developing countries for space technology products, and opportunities existed for joint ventures, more consideration should be given to building up the infrastructure required to successfully implement space programmes.
The importance of having staff that were not only trained, but competent and confident in dealing with all aspects of the applications of space technology, was stressed.
Technological advances must be accompanied by similar progress in the level of understanding of users.
However, while national space coordinating bodies were needed at senior levels to set policy, not every country needed a space agency.
In order to facilitate the implementation of space programmes, international cooperation between developed and developing countries, as well as among developing countries themselves, still needed to be improved.
It was repeatedly recommended that the practical use of satellite data with emphasis being placed on developing simple-to-use and low-cost applications should be promoted in developing countries.
Better access to Internet services should be available for developing countries.
Information on health, remote sensing and GIS was especially useful, and every institution interested in such information should have access to it.
There was a need for better standards and a more liberal approach to pricing in the area of commercial telecommunications.
In that context, international organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union, but also the operators of local platform transmitter terminals (PTTs), should be encouraged to be more liberal in their pricing structures.
To achieve a national commitment to provide resources to space technology, a clear cost-benefit analysis for each project should be prepared for decision makers.
Decision makers in developing countries must be convinced that a judicious expenditure of limited resources on space programmes would substantially contribute to social stability and economic growth.
The need was stressed for participants to pass on their experience to their colleagues, and in particular to decision makers in their home countries.
Furthermore, participants should inform their local PTTs and industries of the discussions and results of the Workshop.
One of the future UN/IAF Workshops should focus on the means of overcoming the regulatory, legal, political, financial and educational obstacles to the better exploitation of space technology in developing countries.
The involvement of the private sector in such meetings should be increased.
In particular, the participation of PTTs and medium-sized companies (of 20 to 100 employees), which could provide relatively low-cost technology and services to developing countries, should be encouraged.
The potential of space technology for improving traditional public health-care services was recognized by participants.
Space technology had a vital role to play in enhancing medical services, medical consulta-tions and the monitoring of epidemic disease, particularly in remote and rural areas.
Recent improvements in satellite communications technology and information systems had resulted in a dramatic increase in telehealth programmes and projects worldwide.
Linking remote locations to an urban medical centre provided an opportunity for specialist consultations that might not be possible otherwise.
Thus, telehealth systems could reduce critical delays in the delivery of health care by providing and expanding access to remote areas.
Whereas some telehealth applications required real-time capability (video conferences for telesurgery, telepsychiatry etc.), other applications, such as image and file transfer, consultations or research, could be supported in a store-and-forward mode.
In the future, telehealth using mobile satellite communications systems such as Inmarsat could form an integral part of national or regional emergency planning.
Developing countries should give higher priority to active participation in, and the application of, space technology in the fields of health care and education.
They should also improve their health care and educational organizations and infrastructures.
The direct and active participation of medical universities in the use and promotion of space technology was critical in public health education and remote medical instruction.
The United Nations and other international organizations could influence policies leading to the development of telehealth and distance education systems where needed.
Current and future satellite systems could do much to rectify the knowledge imbalance that existed in many parts of the world.
However, not only technical, but also regulatory, legal and political issues must be addressed and resolved if support services for health care and education were to be developed. Those issues should not be allowed to inhibit the development of adequate, worldwide satellite services that were already feasible.
The unique capabilities of remote sensing satellites for providing comprehensive, synoptic and multi-temporal coverage of large areas at regular intervals had been and would be an indispensable tool for continuous environmental monitoring.
Although many developing countries had indigenous experts in space applications, it was nevertheless difficult for them to solve environmental problems on their own.
Outside assistance and expert advice was therefore essential to the successful application of space technology for sustainable development.
A more effective coordination policy must be established in many developing countries in order to integrate satellite remote sensing into national, social and economic development programmes.
There were examples of highly qualified individuals in well-equipped remote sensing laboratories who were not contributing to national plans because of the lack of communication with national policy makers and decision makers, who were thus not aware of the benefits that space applications could bring to national efforts to achieve sustainable development.
The pricing and independence of remote sensing data were critical for the integration of remote sensing into national programmes.
Governments and agencies should therefore be encouraged to reduce prices on remote sensing data and to reduce copyright restrictions.
In connection with the joint TREES project of the Commission of the European Communities and ESA, a deforestation monitoring system should be developed, combining low- and high-resolution data and using the Tropical Forest Information System.
Only a few developing countries currently had telecommunications systems capable of coping with disasters.
Furthermore, traditional telecommunications systems were often severely affected by disasters such as earthquakes, floods or hurricanes.
Mobile satellite systems should therefore be used.
Voice, fax and data terminals should continue to be positioned at strategic locations so that an uninterruptible source of warning would be available even if the local radio or television infrastructure had been disabled by a disaster.
A network of terminals would be particularly effective if it were connected to an appropriate regional or global database of GIS or of relevant disaster information.
In many developing countries, land mines presented a serious obstacle to social and economic development.
The process of de-mining was very slow, tedious and dangerous.
Thus, it was recommended that satellite remote sensing should be increasingly used in order to help affected developing countries deal with that problem in a more effective manner.
The continuous establishment of training centres would play a vital role in promoting and applying space technology for sustainable development.
It was suggested that remote sensing and GIS training be combined into one national training centre.
It was also recommended that such centres should train staff from different institutions, so as to encourage information sharing, reduce the amount of overlapping, and minimize the capital investment required.Annex

1. A mobile receiving station which is capable of receiving data from the ERS-1 and ERS-2 radar satellites has been operational at Libreville, Gabon, since late 1994.
The coverage of the station is a roughly circular geographical zone centred on Libreville which extends, to the north-west, as far as eastern Mali, and to the south-west, as far as the western regions of Zambia.
The territories of 23 African countries, of which 17 are francophone, are either wholly or predominantly covered by the Libreville station.
The near-equatorial location of the receiving station and the cloud-penetration characteristics of radar render the station particularly useful to those countries whose exploitation of conventional optical remote sensing data has been severely hampered due to the presence of heavy cloud cover, which often obstructs observation of the ground in equatorial zones.
2. The objective of the training course was to provide participants with the knowledge and skills necessary to use radar data in a number of application areas that correspond with major regional and national interests, in particular those pertaining to agriculture, forestry, geology, mineral exploration and land use.
Knowledge of radar image interpretation is becoming increasingly important because of the growing number of operational and planned radar satellites (e.g. ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS-1, Radarsat) and the attendant increasing use of spaceborne radar as a tool to monitor tropical regions.
The training course was co-sponsored by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the United Nations. It was held at Libreville, Gabon, from 15 to 19 May 1995, for the benefit of francophone countries within the region served by the receiving station.
3. The present report includes descriptions of the organization of the training course and enumerates the recommendations for follow-up action.
In particular, it details plans for a number of projects of regional interest and scope which were elaborated by the participants themselves.
The report has been prepared for the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Scientific and Technical Subcommittee.
Participants are expected to report to the relevant authorities in their countries. B. Organization and programme
4. Application forms and information on the training course were sent out in September 1994 by the United Nations to offices of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for onward transmission to national authorities in 13 countries within the region: Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, C√¥te d'Ivoire, Gabon, Mali, Niger, Togo and Zaire.
5. The training course was attended by 25 participants, 12 of whom were from Gabon.
The other 13 participants were from the following nine countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Congo, Gabon, Niger and Senegal.
Other participants were from the Office for Outer Space Affairs, ESA, German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Scot Conseil and Groupement pour le d√©veloppement de la t√©l√©d√©tection a√©rospatiale (GDTA).
6. Funds for the participation of the 13 international participants from developing countries were obtained from budgetary allocations of the United Nations and from financial support received from ESA.
The Government of Gabon provided secretarial support and local transportation for the benefit of the participants.
7. A high official of the Ministry of Water, Forests, Post and Telecommunications, and the Environment, Mr. O. Mboulamatari, gave an address on behalf of the Government of Gabon at the opening ceremony.
Addresses were also given by the representatives of ESA, UNDP and the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
The Minister of Water, Forests, Post and Telecommunications, and the Environment received the representatives of ESA and the Office for Outer Space Affairs together with nine high-ranking ministry officials.
This ceremony as well as those of the opening and closing of the training course were covered by the local radio, newspaper and television media.
8. The programme of the training course (see annex I) was developed by the United Nations in consultation with ESA.
The course was conducted through a series of lectures and practical exercises which emphasized the use of ERS data but did not exclude discussion of other satellite radar systems.
On the last day of the training course, formal presentations were made followed by discussion of regional projects prepared by the participants in working groups for which access to and the use of ERS data would be a key element.
One of the highlights of the course was a visit to the Libreville ERS receiving station, which was conducted by Mr. K. Reiniger of DLR, and followed a visit to the Ariane tracking station, conducted by Mr. Audegean of the Centre national d'√©tudes spatiales (CNES), the French space agency.
9. The principal instructor of the training course was Mr. M. Fea of ESA.
Supplementary technical presentations were made by the representatives of DLR, GDTA, Scot Conseil and the Office for Outer Space Affairs.
A concise summary of the major topics presented during the training course is given in section I, below.
This is followed, in section II, by a presentation of the recommendations of a number of working groups.
In addition to informal comments communicated to the United Nations during the course, a formal course-evaluation session (see section III, below) was held on the last day of the training course to gather input which would be useful for identifying future activities which would respond best to the needs of countries in the region. The proposed plan of follow-up activities is presented in section IV, below.
I. SUMMARY OF PRESENTATIONS A. European remote sensing satellites and instrumentation 10. There are currently two ERS satellites in operation, ERS-1 and ERS-2, launched in July 1991 and April 1995, respectively.
Both satellites are equipped with microwave (radar) instrumentation which penetrates cloud cover and darkness and provides information 24 hours a day.
The satellites measure many parameters which are not currently measured by existing satellite systems.
ERS data, when used either alone or in conjunction with other data, are particularly useful in the following applications: oceanography, glaciology, meteorology, forestry, soils, agriculture and hydrology.
11. The principal instruments on board the satellites include (a) an Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which comprises a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and a wind scatterometer; (b) a radar altimeter (RA); (c) an along-track scanning radiometer (ATSR), which comprises an infrared radiometer (IRR) and a microwave sounder (MWS); (d) precise range and range-rate equipment (PRARE), presently functioning only on ERS-2; and (e) a laser retroreflector.
In addition, the ERS-2 mission contains the global ozone monitoring experiment (GOME), which provides atmospheric chemistry measurements (ozone and other gases) and an improved ATSR instrument that includes three visible channels.
It also allows the derivation of digital elevation models (topographic maps).
In wave mode, SAR is used to measure ocean-wave spectra and wave direction, while in scatterometer mode, AMI is used to measure wind direction and speed at the ocean surface.
The radar altimeter permits the measurement of wind speed, wave height, sea-surface elevation, ice profile, land and ice topography, and sea-ice boundaries.
ATSR is used to measure the surface temperatures of the sea, land and clouds.
It is also used in the measurement of cloud cover, aerosols, vegetation, atmospheric water vapour and liquid water content.
PRARE on ERS-2 provides precise corrections of altimeter measurements.
The laser retroreflector is a passive optical device used as a target by ground-based laser ranging stations in order to determine the accurate position of the satellite.1
13. The participants from countries in the equatorial regions of Africa showed the greatest interest in the terrestrial applications of images obtained using the SAR instrument.
In image mode, the SAR instrument acquires strips of images 100 km in width to the right of the satellite track.
The ground spatial resolution is 25 m.
It is different from optical sensors in that it operates within a frequency range, designated C-band, at a nominal frequency of 5.3 GHz with vertical transmission and vertical reception of radar signals (VV polarization) and a look angle of 23 degrees.
14. ERS-1 has a sun-synchronous, near polar, quasi-circular orbit with a mean altitude of 785 km and an inclination of 98.5 degrees.
It has a 35-day repeat cycle with a re-visit period of 16-18 days. Its orbital cycle is 101 minutes.
The data transmission rate for the SAR instrument is 105 megabits per second. On-board recorders cannot be used to store SAR data, which can only be transmitted to receiving stations when these are in sight.
ERS-2 is similar in operation to ERS-1.
Following the commissioning phase of ERS-2, the two satellites will operate in tandem with ERS-2 following ERS-1 at a separation time of 1 day.
This time of separation is subject to change.
It is planned to maintain the ground track between the two satellites at 50-600 metres in order to improve opportunities for interferometric applications.
B. Interpretation of European remote sensing satellite data for applications of national interest
15. Radar remote sensing from space has a number of advantages over airborne radar.
Unlike spaceborne radar where the incidence angle changes very little, in airborne applications there is a large change in incidence angle across the image swath, which causes difficulty in distinguishing whether changes in backscatter are related simply to changes in incident angle or to changes in the geometry and/or the materials themselves.
The look angle for the ERS satellites is 23 degrees (the local angle of incidence on the ground is slightly greater than this due to the curvature of Earth).
At this look angle, radar backscatter is strongly influenced by topographic slope.
Hence, surface features which give rise to changes in topography, e.g. geological lineaments which may indicate mineral occurrences, are more easily interpretable using spaceborne imagery.
Nevertheless, effects such as radar shadowing, layover (relief displacement) and foreshortening can complicate the visual interpretation of imagery of areas of rugged terrain.
16. Radar backscatter is dominated by the geometrical and electrical properties of surface materials, a fact which must be taken into account during the interpretation of radar images.
Materials of varying roughness - a factor which is dependent on the particular radar wavelength being used - reflect the radar signal in different ways.
Rough surfaces cause diffuse reflections in all directions and a significant portion of the signal is returned to the sensor.
Smooth surfaces result in specular reflection with practically all of the signal being reflected away from the sensor.
Very high return signals occur when adjacent smooth surfaces form right angles, which cause a double reflection and hence high return signals to the sensor.
This occurs naturally, for example, in the case of tree trunks standing in swampy, water-logged areas.
17. The electrical character of surface material, as indicated by its complex dielectric constant, is also critical in the interpretation of radar images.
Radar reflectivity is considerably increased in the presence of water, which has a dielectric constant greater than 10 times that of dry materials.
This characteristic makes radar imagery especially useful in differentiating areas of dry from moist soil and in the identification of vegetated zones often characterized by high humidity that would give rise to a strong radar response.
18. Radar reflection from vegetation is also influenced by the type of polarization.
In general, like-polarized signals, such as the VV polarization of the ERS instruments, are better at penetrating vegetation than crossed-polarized signals.
While ERS and Radarsat satellites operate in the C-band, JERS-1 operates in the longer L-band.
Radar penetration of vegetation - forests and agricultural crops - is influenced by the wavelength of the signal.
Shorter wavelengths may be scattered by the tree canopy, however, longer wavelengths tend to penetrate it and be reflected by the underlying soil.
The use of radar images of multiple wavelengths from multiple space platforms (e.g. ERS/Radarsat, JERS-1, Shuttle Imaging Radar/Seasat) can therefore provide more information and allow for better differentiation in certain land-cover and forestry studies.
19. In general, through a knowledge of the interdependence of the factors which have a major influence on radar response (e.g. incidence angle, moisture content, surface roughness, geometry and slope orientation), ERS imagery corresponding to a single date can be interpreted for a variety of terrestrial applications.
These applications can be placed in one or more of the following categories: (a) feature identification, (b) determination of the spatial extent of a feature of interest, (c) detection of change, e.g. deforestation, and (d) quantitative determination of biogeophysical parameters, e.g. soil-water content.
20. The interpretation of ERS imagery can be facilitated by digital enhancement procedures (filtering, colour coding etc.) that serve to highlight particular features of interest.
Radar images are often characterized by speckle, which appears as a salt-and-pepper pattern.
This effect is due to random constructive and destructive interference of radar waves that results in a random pattern of light and dark areas on the imagery.
Speckle can be reduced by application of appropriate digital filtering or multi-look processing procedures.
The reduction of speckle is a necessary precursor to computer classification of radar imagery as well as to visual interpretation since it tends to mask fine details.
21. In addition to the various possible enhancement of imagery from a single date, images from multiple dates can be exploited to yield new information, e.g. change detection.
A single image from a given date may not be sufficient to differentiate several different crop types.
However, two or more images acquired at different times during the growing season may allow differentiation of crop cover.
Soils whose moisture content evolves differently during the year may be differentiated using multiple-date images.
22. In instances when both optical and radar satellite images are available, the two can be merged to exploit the complementarity that exists between the two data sets.
Techniques for merging optical and radar data, such as the construction of colour composites and intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transformations, can be employed to emphasize or de-emphasize surface features while retaining information from both data sets.
Such merging operations must overcome difficulties of image co-registration, i.e. the accurate matching of common features appearing on both images when these are superimposed.
For this reason, in areas of appreciable relief, a digital elevation model is used during registration to correct for relief displacements.
23. The technique of interferometry, by which the "phase" difference associated with a given pixel from two SAR images is analysed, allows for precise determination of elevation.
The preparation of precise topographic maps from SAR images is therefore possible.
Differential interferometry also allows for the monitoring of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
C. Data access and processing
24. Information on the availability of processed ERS data collected at the Libreville station and archived at the DLR facility at Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany, is readily available using a software program called DESC developed by ESA.
The program allows interactive searching of a database to find and identify image frames which correspond to a geographic region of interest.
This database is periodically updated by ESA and distributed to registered users.
Updates can also be obtained electronically via the Internet.
25. The high volumes of data associated with digital processing (e.g. geocoding, enhancements) of ERS images necessitate access to fairly powerful PC-based systems with software capable of processing and displaying 16-bit ERS images.
In addition, the production of high-quality prints of the digitally enhanced images would require access to large-format printers.
The high costs inherent in the acquisition of these items of equipment may put digital image processing of radar data out of the reach of some African institutions.
However, the preparation of large-scale photographic prints of ERS images may be more cost-effective if it is initially left to service companies in Europe and elsewhere.
II. RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE WORKING GROUPS
26. Based on the potential usefulness of satellite radar data as presented during the training course, the participants identified a number of projects which could benefit from the radar data collected at the Libreville receiving station.
Some of these projects are already ongoing and involve the institutions to which the participants are attached.
The remainder are newly conceived project proposals.
The projects listed represent the output of three working groups, corresponding to each of the three application themes.
These groups were constituted specifically to discuss national and regional development issues and to identify specific target activities which can benefit from the exploitation of ERS data.
The working groups also made a number of recommendations which aim at enhancing the use of ERS data by countries within the region.
These recommendations are aimed at all relevant entitites, including the United Nations, Governments and space agencies, whose timely interventions may serve to improve the present situation.
The recommendations have been synthesized and are as follows:
(a) Participants should have access to more in-depth training on detailed radar image interpretation.
In general, while a one-week training course is good for a general introduction to radar, a course lasting approximately three weeks is needed to develop the technical confidence needed to use the data on an operational basis;
(b) A follow-up training course should be organized to share operational experiences on applications of ERS data and to consolidate technical concepts introduced during the present course;
(c) Countries within the region should have access to the ERS images collected by the Libreville station;
(d) Cooperation between South-South and North-South in matters related to ERS data should be promoted and strengthened;
(e) Training should be given in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and the integration of radar and other remote sensing data in GIS systems;
(f) Countries within the region should have access to technical assistance in matters related to the exploitation of radar images within an operational setting;
(g) National and regional institutions should be invited to participate in the demonstration studies of ERS data from the Libreville station.
27. There is as yet limited experience on the use of satellite radar images in tropical regions.
For this reason, the operational usefulness of ERS data in African countries needs to be demonstrated.
Necessarily, such a demonstration should involve African institutions and professionals who are knowledgeable of ground conditions and can attest to the usefulness and applicability of the radar data under their local conditions.
28. As illustrated in annex II, the problems which have already been encountered in existing projects or those that are envisaged in proposed ones concern the presence of heavy cloud cover on conventional optical satellite images.
Thus, a principal need is adequate access to the radar images which have been collected by the ERS station at Libreville.
29. Only a few of the participants came from institutions which possessed the computer hardware and software needed for digital processing of voluminous ERS radar.
Consequently, there was considerable discussion on ways in which to gain immediate access to the paper prints of digital images which would be suitably enhanced so as to highlight particular features of thematic interest, e.g. geology, land use and land cover, agriculture and forestry.
In that regard, it appears that private companies in Europe which already have experience in the digital processing and enhancement of ERS data as well as in their photographic reproduction may be used to create large-scale photomaps.
Such maps could easily be used at the present time by all of the countries represented at the training course.
An eventual progression towards the digital processing and printing of ERS images is, however, highly desirable, particularly by participants from those national institutions which already have several years of experience in digital image analysis.
III. COURSE EVALUATION
30. Suggestions abstracted from the evaluation sheets filled in by the participants are as follows:
(a) Access to more detailed training (lasting at least 10 days) is highly desirable, in association with national or international entities experienced in the specific area of application;
(b) The course should devote more time for practical exercises;
(c) French documentation on ERS radar applications in all themes of interest should be made available;
(d) A wider distribution of information concerning training courses should be made available well ahead of their scheduling;
(e) Consideration should be given in order to avoid problems of distribution, to making direct contact with the national agencies or contact persons concerned, perhaps using electronic means, in addition to the normal official channels;
(f) The United Nations and ESA should maintain contact with the participants after the course in order to keep them abreast of developments in satellite radar technology;
(g) A follow-up meeting should be held in one or two years;
(h) Access should be given to training on digital analysis of radar images.
IV. PROPOSED FOLLOW-UP PLAN OF ACTION
31. The Office for Outer Space Affairs together with ESA propose to respond to the recommendations of the working groups and the various comments made during the course evaluation by undertaking the following activities:
(a) A number of projects will be selected from among those already proposed by the participants for possible assistance.
In this regard, more detailed proposals than those elaborated during the course will be solicited from the participants in order to evaluate properly the relative merits of the various proposals and to facilitate the selection, on a competitive basis, of a number of projects worthy of support;
(b) Subsequently, arrangements will be made for supporting the selected projects within the framework of an assistance programme currently being developed jointly by the Office for Outer Space Affairs and ESA.
As envisaged, this programme will provide limited support (e.g. training, access to satellite images and selected items of equipment needed for image interpretation) for ongoing activities;
(c) Expansion of the distribution of information related to the scheduling of the various training programmes and workshops organized each year by the Office for Outer Space Affairs will be made progressively to include selected national institutions whose activities may benefit from the application of space technology.
Priority will be given to information distribution by electronic means (e.g. e-mail);
Specifically, the names of all course participants has been put on the ESA mailing list to receive the Earth Observation Quarterly.
In addition, ESA has mailed copies of the DESC software program to all participants.);
(e) A follow-up advanced training course/seminar will be held involving participants who will have used ERS data from the Libreville station in an operational setting.

A. Astronomy and space physics
During Fiscal Year 1994 (FY 1994), space scientists continued to add to the fund of information about the universe gathered not only through instruments located on Earth, but also from those on satellites above the distorting medium of the home planet's atmosphere.
For example, scientists working on the Hubble Space Telescope team made a number of important discoveries during FY 1994, including images of an exploding star (Nova Cygni 1992).
Many of these findings preceded the highly successful servicing mission in December 1993 when astronauts on STS-61 replaced several faulty parts and installed a sophisticated package of corrective optics to compensate for the spherical aberration in HST's primary mirror.
Coin-sized mirrors on the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacements units have since served as "contact lenses" for HST.
While the telescope has always had a view of the sky unobstructed by haze from the Earth, scientists since have been able to accomplish all the astronomical goals initially planned for the most sophisticated observatory ever built.
In the process, HST's first servicing mission proved the capability of NASA's highly trained astronauts to work productively in space.
As one fruit of their efforts, an astronomer from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO), heading an international team, used HST's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in May 1994 to obtain valuable new images of Supernova 1994I, discovered by amateur astronomers in April 1994 in the inner regions of the "Whirlpool Galaxy," M51.
HST has the unique capability of imaging and measuring the spectra of distant supernovae in ultraviolet light.
As the M51 supernova ages, Hubble will "see" more deeply into the interior of the exploding star.
This will permit astronomers to probe the chemical composition of the debris and learn more about the type of star that exploded.
The team of scientists hope thereby to learn which stars explode as supernovae, what chemical elements are ejected, and how to use these bright events as yardsticks for measuring the size of the universe.
In June 1994, two scientists using the HST discovered disks of protoplanetary dust around stars in the Orion Nebula region of the Milky Way galaxy.
This revelation indicates that the formation of planets may be relatively common both in the Milky Way and in other parts of the universe.
The newly found disks contain many of the same basic chemicals that compose the planets in our solar system.
Because planets are the only heavenly bodies that can support life as we know it, the existence of planets around other stars would raise the likelihood of life in other parts of the universe.
Then in July 1994, an international team of astronomers using HST's Faint Object Camera confirmed that helium is widespread throughout the early universe, a key hypothesis of the Big Bang theory.
The discovery of helium in the constellation of Cetus, which is 13 billion light years away, gives scientists valuable information about conditions at the time of the universe's initial evolution.
Additionally, this finding lends further weight to the scientists' conception of chemical evolution in the universe; scientists believe that hydrogen and helium evolved within three minutes after the Big Bang, while heavier elements such as oxygen and carbon came later.
In other developments, scientists analyzing data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), which was launched in April 1991, found new evidence that gamma-ray bursts extend into the far reaches of the universe and thus bear an imprint of the universe's expansion.
These huge explosions come from all directions, suggesting a cosmological cause; until this discovery it was believed that the bursts were limited to within the Milky Way galaxy.
Because the bursts come from so far away, they demonstrate "time dilation," an effect created when time seems to be running more slowly at the bursts' source than at their destination, since the universe itself is thought to be expanding.
Relatedly, the CGRO's Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) provided the first detailed all sky map of highly energetic gamma ray objects, pointing out several different types of gamma ray sources.
Scientists believe, for example, that the interactions of cosmic ray particles with gas between the stars produce diffuse gamma ray emissions from our Milky Way galaxy.
Within this band are gamma ray pulsars and other unidentified sources of gamma rays.
Astronomers analyzing EGRET's data have also identified what they think are massive black holes in the middle of distant galaxies that are sending gamma rays in Earth's direction.
Similarly, the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer (EUVE), launched in June 1992, produced the first all-sky map in four extreme ultraviolet wavelength bands.
This survey has identified large numbers of very hot stars such as white dwarfs and active corona stars.
For purposes of comparison, scientists also surveyed a companion area along half the ecliptic plane on which Earth travels around the Sun.
Space physicists using the Solar, Anomalous, and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer (SAMPEX), launched in June 1992, discovered a radiation belt of trapped anomalous cosmic rays in the magnetosphere.
They have determined the chemical composition and electrical charge of these rays in the region beyond the Earth's upper atmosphere where the planet's magnetic field affects charged particles.
In addition, these scientists have learned a lot about the effects of electrons in the upper atmosphere.
SAMPEX's mission is to monitor energetic electrons and atomic ions from the Sun and from interplanetary, interstellar, and magnetospheric space.
Space physicists also achieved breakthroughs in computer modeling.
In particular, complex numerical modeling has led to a detailed conception of the Earth's magnetosphere.
As a result, scientists are now able to predict "space weather" caused by solar-terrestrial interactions.
Investigators using computer simulations have also gained a refined understanding of the heliopause, the boundary of the solar system where the solar wind's outward flow is balanced by the pressure of the interstellar medium.
SPARTAN 201-2, a small satellite deployed and then retrieved several days later by the Space Shuttle Discovery in September 1994, examined the Sun's hot outer atmosphere, or extended corona, and the solar wind, the flow of charged ions from the Sun.
On its second of four planned missions aboard the Shuttle, SPARTAN contained two instruments--the NASA-designed White Light Coronograph to measure the density and distribution of the electrons in the coronal holes and polar plumes of the Sun and the Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer, designed by the SAO.
Together, the two instruments can determine the velocity of the solar wind as it accelerates out of the Sun so that scientists can grasp exactly how and when the Sun creates this wind as well as what the shape and spectroscopy of the solar corona may be.
The measurements made by SPARTAN 201 will be used in conjunction with those from the Ulysses spacecraft, which was launched in October 1990 and which detected the solar wind from the south polar corona as SPARTAN observed the source region of that wind as well as other portions of the Sun's corona.
Data from SPARTAN 201 will also calibrate measurements to be made by the European Space Agency (ESA)-NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, scheduled for launch in 1995.
